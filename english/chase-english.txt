I've taken off running! Off to strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll grip your hand tight

I've always betrayed my most important feelings
But yesterday, I said bye-bye
To the risks and regrets
That I've searched for over and over as excuses
I'll stop letting them control me

My feet are moving, it might be scary at first
But a heart that wants to keep going is all I need!

I've taken off running! Off to strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll grip your hand tight
You don't have to wait to be who you want to be
My dream will one day shine forth!

I won't fight this fight with half-baked feelings
There's not a single regret left on the stage
Because when I compare my ideals and my reality
Though I've yet to reach it
I can feel the goal at the end of the road

We need hard work and persistence, there will be sleepless nights
But it's your "I want to see your smile!". Yes, as long everyone's here!

I'm springing off! My feelings aren't a lie
The hope born from my tears
Connects me to a strength my eyes can't see
My dream will one day shine forth!

I only need to close my eyes to see it again
My heart beating, I'll entrust the future I believe in here
The moment the world takes on colors and shines
I want to see it with you, my heart answers

I've taken off running! Off to strengthen my feelings
When I'm worried I'll grip your hand tight
You don't have to wait to be who you want to be
My dream will one day shine forth!

I'm springing off! My feelings aren't a lie
The hope born from my tears
Connects me to a strength my eyes can't see
My dream will one day shine forth!
