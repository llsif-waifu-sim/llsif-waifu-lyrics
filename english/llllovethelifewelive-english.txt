Love the Life We Live
Let's feel this feeling and connect our dreams to tomorrow

Beneath the sky that spreads far and wide
Is a world full of encounters and mysteries
Where do you want to go? Hey, what do you want to see?
I already know the answer that's rising inside of me

I want to share my blooming excitement with you
Now I want to send it to you more and more

Love the Life We Live
It's time for our hearts to dance joyfully
Point our lights towards the future
Believing in our true feelings,
Let's connect to our tomorrow
Let's go boldly! C'mon, let's all go together
Finding the treasures around the world

I want to send it to you. I want to see you.
I want to tell you again and again
