Let's play! A happy greeting tune
Let's play! Because I met you
It's both a sign and a miracle
I want to dream of our exciting miracle
It's starting, so come here and listen to my heart!!

Today we'll smile cheerfully
And our excited hearts will ring out
We'll complete this spectacular mission!

What do you all want to hear? You can rely on us
What do you all want to do? We're taking suggestions!

Let's overwrite those lonely feelings with fun things
We'll make this a place to laugh - idle talk is a form of medicine, you know?

The sky is blue today
We'll talk excitedly, too
Say goodbye to your frowns, and don't stop them on their way out!

If you speak your desires, they'll come true
Let's talk about our dreams, forever
We'll surely achieve them one day

Let's sing! A happy tune that'll make us want to dance
Let's sing! About when we met
It was both a sign and a miracle
It's mysterious, but we're getting along
Let's play! A happy greeting tune
Let's play! Because I met you
It's both a sign and a miracle
I want to dream of our exciting miracle
It's starting, so come here and listen to my heart!!

Today we'll smile cheerfully
And our excited hearts will ring out
We'll complete this spectacular mission!

Where do you all want to go? How about our live?
We'd be so happy if you came!

I want to reset these boring days with happy things
Happiness is overflowing from this light filled with music

The sky will be blue tomorrow
We'll talk openly, too
Ride on the seagulls, let's go! No one can stop us!

When our ideals get so hot that they scorch our hearts
We'll talk about our dreams, forever
We'll surely achieve them one day

Let's sing! A happy tune that'll make us want to dance
Let's sing! About when we met
It was both a sign and a miracle
It's mysterious, but we're getting along
Let's play! A happy greeting tune
Let's play! Because I met you
It's both a sign and a miracle
I want to dream of our exciting miracle
It's starting, so come here and listen to my heart!!

We'll smile cheerfully tomorrow
And our hearts will ring out
We'll complete this energetic mission!
