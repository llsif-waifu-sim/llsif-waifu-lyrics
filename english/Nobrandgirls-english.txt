(Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
One step, one leap!)
(Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Hey, we won't lose, you know!)

It's frustrating, we're still No brand
No one knows of us, we're No brand
Everything starts from this passionate feeling

We're having fun, but we're still No brand (Do you know?)
I'm getting fired up, No brand (Do you know?)
So (Come on) In order to meet here (Yes, I know!)

The place we aim for is (High)
Higher than now (How far?)
This chance won't come twice, so
(Grab it) We won't let go
(Tightly) We won't let go
(Oh yeah!) We'll cross the rainbow of miracles

Walls (Hi Hi Hi) Can be demolished (Hi Hi Hi) Can be toppled
Summon more courage from within yourself
(Hi Hi Hi) They can be demolished (Hi Hi Hi) They can be toppled
Bravely, show us our future!
(Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Yeah, we're not gonna lose!)

Hurting each other is No good
Falling out is No good
Misunderstanding love is a bitter feeling

The pain in your chest is No Good (hurry-up!)
Giving up is No good (hurry-up!)
Yep, if we can become (Strong) Our feelings can come true (Yes, I go!)

The place we desire is (Far)
It's still far, far off (Where is it?)
Get closer with a jump
(Today) As you reach up
(Firmly) And I reach up, too
(Oh yeah!) We'll search for the vow that we made that day

The darkness (Hi Hi Hi) Let's blow it away (Hi Hi Hi) Let's drive it away
You can change the present from within yourself
(Hi Hi Hi) Let's blow it away (Hi Hi Hi) Let's drive it away
Bravely, show us our future!
That's right, we're all set!

(Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!)
(Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!)

Walls (Hi Hi Hi) Can be demolished (Hi Hi Hi) Can be toppled
Summon more courage from within yourself
(Hi Hi Hi) They can be demolished (Hi Hi Hi) They can be toppled
Bravely, show us our future!
That's right, we're all set!

(Oh yeah! Whole body and soul!)
(Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!)
