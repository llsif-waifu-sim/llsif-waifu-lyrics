uoy ekil I
You know that, right?
I like you (I love you)

With something other than effort, if searching for the things that can be done
Should I use the power of prayer? Or even magic?
It's worth a try right?
So closing my eyes gently, stroking your cheek
I want to convey the miracle of us two, aiming for your heart

Trying to call out to you with a louder voice might be good
But rather than a loud voice, I'm more familiar with love!

Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
"Like" is always the reverse of "hate"
Cute but hateful, that's right
That's just a so-called "love"
Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
I can't just say "I like you"
Muttering enigmatic words, that's right
Hurry up and notice!

uoy ekil I
You know that, right?
I like you (I love you)

A future better than expected, that's what I covet
Is it tenacity, or just being a sore loser?
I think I won't give up
Yet you won't change from how you always are
These feelings you show me are a mystery, we have to clarify them

After all during the times I want to meet, even trying to call out won't reach you
That's why this spell that makes you come to meet me, this is my trump card!

If a mistake of a mistake is fine,
"Yes" is probably "no" right
Holding you dear but feeling sinful, that's right
That's also probably just love
If a mistake of a mistake is fine,
"Yes!" is easier for me to want to say
Enigmatic words are easy, that's right
I'll understand in ten seconds

Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
"Like" is always the reverse of "hate"
Cute but hateful, that's right
That's just a so-called "love"
Take a look at the upside-down of the upside-down
I can't just say "I like you"
Muttering enigmatic words, that's right
Hurry up and notice!

uoy ekil I
You know that, right?
I like you (I love you)
