Don't be afraid to tell me about your failures and worries
We shouldn't keep secrets from each other, right? Right?
It's embarrassing to call it friendship, though
I'll always be by your side, right? Right?

"I like this!" 'I don't.' Huh? We disagree?
It's fine to have different opinions
There's nothing wrong with that (We're pure girls!)
This is our declaration of purity! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Let's walk, let's walk
We'll have lots of fun together today
Let's talk, let's talk
There's no stopping our chatter
Let's walk, let's walk
We'll have lots of fun together today
Let's give it our all!
First and foremost is what's right in front of us
Right? (Yeah!) Right? (Yeah!) Let's prepare our route!

It's boring to always feel safe and secure, right?
In the end I want to try something new; shall we? Shall we?
Friendship is like an ally of adventure
My feelings won't be enough without it, so shall we? Shall we?

"I'll come!" 'I won't." Huh? You don't know?
It's okay to not be able to decide
Everyone's right in the end (We're pure girls!)
This is our declaration of purity! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Let's dance, let's dance
We'll make the fun times last longer
Let's laugh, let's laugh
As we come up with new dance choreography
Let's dance, let's dance
We'll make the fun times last longer
We gave it our all!
Now all that's left is to give in to sweet temptation
Shall we? (Yeah!) Shall we? (Yeah!) Let's reward ourselves!

Let's walk, let's walk - We'll have lots of fun together today
Let's talk, let's talk - There's no stopping our chatter
Let's walk, let's walk - We'll have lots of fun together today
Let's give it our all!

Let's dance, let's dance
We'll make the fun times last longer
Let's laugh, let's laugh
As we come up with new dance choreography
Let's dance, let's dance
We'll make the fun times last longer
We gave it our all!
Now all that's left is to give in to sweet temptation
Shall we? (Yeah!) Shall we? (Yeah!) Let's reward ourselves!
Right? (Yeah!) Right? (Yeah!) Let's prepare our route!
