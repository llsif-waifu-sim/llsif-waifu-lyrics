With the power of love, shall we try to fly?
Because something is waiting for us over there
Oh yeah! That's right...!

If we can't understand difficult things
Then let's communicate with our smiles
Thank you, because I met you
I'm really glad, for these enjoyable days

Though I felt like there was
Other emotions I wanted to convey
Shall we dance? (That's right) Let's dance (More)
Get on the rhythm
HEART to HEART to HEART!

With the power of love, shall we try to fly?
Because something is waiting for us over there
With the power of love, I want to fly
If you say those words it'll come true, it'll definitely come true!
(Come on, you have to say it) Try shouting it out loud

If it's easy things we understand them
If you believe in love you can hang in there
(Hang in there ONEDAY)
Thank you, meeting you was
a wonderful fate; these happy days (are wonderful, aren't they)

Hold on to all the memories (There're loads of them)
I'm counting on you from here on too, and
Shall we dance? (That's right) Let's dance (More)
This won't end
HEART to HEART to HEART!
(1,2,3,4! This can't end!)

This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
And has been wishing for all this time
This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
If you say those words it'll come true, it'll definitely come true!
(Come on, loudly) Believe in the power of love
This dreamscape (Together with everyone)
Let's watch it together (Together with everyone)
With the power of love (Together with everyone)
Let's watch it together (Together with everyone)

With the power of love, shall we try to fly?
Because something is waiting for us over there
With the power of love, I want to fly
If you say those words it'll come true
This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
And has been wishing for all this time (Forever and ever)
This dreamscape, is what everyone wants to see
If you say those words it'll come true (Come on, you have to say it)
It'll definitely come true! Try shouting it out loud!
(Come on, you have to say it) Try shouting it out loud
