We're the MONSTER GIRLS
We're the MONSTER GIRLS

C'mon, right now, everybody
I want to believe we're the MONSTER GIRLS
Now, come on, everybody
Further new world, we're the stars

From now on, no one can stop us
You know who it is?
We're the MONSTER GIRLS

This world is like a spiral
Who can stand on this stage? Say it loud loud loud loud
Let me hear the dazzling, wonderful voices
Who can stand on this stage? Say it loud loud loud loud

This rhythm rises at a speed
Don't be shaken off
Our time and nobody else beat us, baby
Follow, follow me now
Come on, say

MONSTER GIRLS taste it at its fastest
MONSTER GIRLS today's delicious part
MONSTER GIRLS I'll catch your heart
Hold on, never let go

Our freedom voices at a high volume
Vibrate the speakers, boom boom
MONSTER GIRLS I'll catch your heart
Hold on, never let go
