Do you have some time, some time,
To spare this time
Today I really want to tell you!
(Dear My friends!)

The truth is, the truth is
I always wanted to tell you
Thank you always and always
(My precious friends)

We like to always do our best
(We won't lose! We won't lose!)
If you ever come by (Go! Go!) we'll be waiting here!

The way we come together is sparkling (Yes!)
Rainbow colours overflowing (Yes!)
That we met is a greater miracle than any treasure

Our love is starting to bloom (Yes!)
This dream we all have
Together we'll make it real
Let's jump into a bright tomorrow
Love U my friends 

Ba-dump, ba-dump
I'm shaking with excitement
We get so hype while together
(Dear my friends!!!)

I'm getting thrilled more and more
Though it has changed some
Even now, that scenery
(I'll never forget)

Do you remember our promise?
"Of course! Of course!"
That oath in our hearts (Go! Go!) let's sing it again today!

Our world is twinkling (Yes!)
Rainbow colours overflowing (Yes!)
As many times as we like, we can set off for the future we dreamed of

Our love is starting to bloom (Yes!)
This dream we all have
Together we'll make it real
Let's jump into a bright tomorrow
Love U my friends

Suddenly, the door is closed
There are days when you're frustrated
Even so, even so
All you have to do is smile!

Time to time we fight
Then get anxious being alone
Then after some tears
There! We see a rainbow!

The way we come together is sparkling (Yes!)
Rainbow colours overflowing (Yes!)
That we met is a greater miracle than any treasure

Our love is starting to bloom (Yes!)
This dream we all have
Together we'll make it real
Let's jump into a bright tomorrow
Love U my friends
