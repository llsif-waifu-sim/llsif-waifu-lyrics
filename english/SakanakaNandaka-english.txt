(1,2,3!)

Relax even more! Your body and your mind too
Get released from this world right now
Hey, do you know me?
I wonder if you can become a fish

Relax, just float up and gaze into the distance
The sky that you're familiar with is beautiful
Ah, let's just dissolve into this clear water

The waves ebbs and flows in order to sing
My tanned skin feels nice and cool
If you close your eyes because it's too bright,
All your worries will disappear

All the fishes! Continually swim into
All the fishes! The free future
The fickle dream swaying in the waves
Won't be caught, let's chase after them!
All the fishes! Swim easily into
All the fishes! The free future
Holding nothing but hopes and wishes
Tomorrow, let's play in this sea too!
