I want to dance as my brand new self
Twirl-twirl, whenever I twirl around and take a jump
The sight of my fluttering skirt makes me so happy
That I just have to twirl around again

I can be true to myself now, so
Twirl-twirl! I'll twirl around and chase after my goal
To all of you, who gave me this bit of courage
I want to say I love you!

There's still a lot more to go
If I run down the path to girlhood from the starting point
It might be there, waiting for me... Love's signal!

It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
If you're getting a sense for the future, twirl around, yay!
It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
"I'm getting a sense for the future," the wind whispers
My chest burns hot with anticipation
I want to become cute -- That's one of my dreams!

It's not bad to want to doll myself up, right?
Sparkle-sparkle! I want to shine brightly
I've fiddled with my hair again and again
Today, I'll definitely make your hearts flutter!

I'm almost there!
The girly tempo of a beginner maiden rises bit by bit
More and more!
I'm running down the path to girlhood from the starting point
That's where it's waiting for me, love's fated signal!

It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
I wink at the mirror -- Yes, sparkle-sparkle!
It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
My reflection in the mirror just might be cute
I'm not confident yet, but I'm going to do my best
I want to become lovely! I'll seriously strive for that goal!

It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
If you're getting a sense for the future, twirl around, yay!
It's such a miracle! Twirling around
Yeah, it must be a miracle
I can feel the future! Twirl and twirl

It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
I wink at the mirror -- Yes, sparkle-sparkle!
It definitely is a miracle! Sparkling brightly
Every day is a miracle
Aiming for cuteness -- That's one of my dreams!
