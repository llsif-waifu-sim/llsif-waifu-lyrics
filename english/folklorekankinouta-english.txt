An ode to joy. Go forth, folklore.

A scented fragrance, and rays of sunshine
A light green silhouette
There's an orchestra in A・ZU・NA's forest

Trees are dancing softly, many tress are dancing
A quintet of swaying petals
All living things have gathered here:
A carnival of dreams where we hold hands

Palila, palila
Let's sing it together
The faerie lace echoes in the sky
Puala, puala
There is a rainbow arch
Leading to your place

Thank you for being born
