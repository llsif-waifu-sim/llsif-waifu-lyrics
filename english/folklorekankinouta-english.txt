Ode to joy! Folklore!

A scented breeze, rays of sunshine, and a light green silhouette
There's an orchestra in A・ZU・NA's forest

Fluttering butterflies; dancing trees
There's even a quintet of swaying petals
All living things have gathered here!
It's a carnival of dreams where we hold hands

Party Live! (Party Live!) Party Live! (Party Live!)
Let's sing it together
The fairy path echoes up into the sky
Pure Life! (Pure Life!) Pure Life! (Pure Life!)
There is a rainbow arch
Leading to your place

Pure-rara-lu Parira-ta-ta
Pure-rara-lu Parira-ta-ta
Thank you for being born!

At dusk, the moon float heads
Towards the first star
The parade of light shall continue

A melody flows around the camp fire
Fantasia of animals
This gentle warmth that we've encountered
Is a wonderful utopia that we share

Party Live! (Party Live!) Party Live! (Party Live!)
Bringing hope with us
For this fairy path will continue on forever
Pure Life! (Pure Life!) Pure Life! (Pure Life!)
I shall give you this
Ode to joy! Folklore!

Pure-rara-lu Parira-ta-ta
(Pure-parira-ta)
(Pure-ralu-ta-parira)

Bringing love, dreams, and hope with us
For this fairy path will continue on forever

Party Live! (Party Live!) Party Live! (Party Live!)
Let's sing it together
The fairy path echoes up into the sky
Pure Life! (Pure Life!) Pure Life! (Pure Life!)
I shall give you this
Ode to joy! Folklore!

Pure-rara-lu Parira-ta-ta

Thank you for being born!
