My future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly
My future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly

You don't want to be disappointed
But what do you intend to protect?
Isn't it fine to feel down too
Climb aboard this seesaw game

I've cried over and over again
Because I want to be overwhelmed with emotion
Don't you hate being wishy-washy?
I've decided on a happy choice

Don't run away (barely making it) but (within this world)
The dashing future
Thrilling one way
That is what's truly full of prospects
I just want to feel the warmth of life

My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's my heart's wish to play across this world
My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's not for anyone else's sake, but for my own selfish passion


Are you being proud with pride?
Give it up, let's go and be bad
What I absolutely want to do is
to aim for your mono Poker Face

I will not yield it
As it's rude to my opponent
These Setbacks are inevitable
When grabbing the Lucky Star

Anxiously (Also astray) finding (The Path)
Running to the future (My future)
Thrilling One Way
That's what my true instinct is
I just want to feel the burning fire of life

This messy wish can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's our ambition to fulfill it across this world
This messy wish can't be stopped, can't be stopped
Everyone is hiding it
Just do it for yourself, let's go!

It's getting hot
It's getting hot
I want to feel that I am living


Barely making through the dashing future
That is what's truly full of prospects
I just want to feel the warmth of life

My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's my heart's wish to play across this world
My overflowing feelings can't be stopped, can't be stopped
It's not for anyone else's sake, but for my own selfish passion
Just do it for yourself, let's go!

My future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly
My future, I'll try, try, try
To run towards it earnestly
