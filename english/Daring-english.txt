Daring! You'll be wild!!

Don't worry, don't worry!
(You're a challenger starting now?)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(No hesitation, go, go!!)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(Don't lose heart, how boring!)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(No hesitation, go, go!!)

Are you gonna ask? 
That I've got no want for love?
You asked! 
Hey, that was only a joke!
I'm being drawn towards you pushily and forcibly
But, you know, it's not gonna work
Just kidding, it makes me happy

Let me carry you past the peak; 
My aesthetics / My beauty
Let me carry you past the peak; 
I'm an unreachable high-priced flower
I say "No. 1", 
My love only one!

(Daring!! baby!)

Don't worry, don't worry!
(You're a challenger starting now?)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(No hesitation, Go go!!)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(Don't lose heart, how boring!)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(No hesitation, Go go!!)

Allow me to teach you the feel of an icy burn
Don't worry, don't worry! 
So, so passionate
Deeply in love, you want to know my serious answer
Don't worry, don't worry! 
(No hesitation, go, go!!)

Are you gonna ask? 
The type I'm into?
Ask me! 
Well, I haven't really got any conditions
With an impatient ardor, shake me up
The exciting, fervorous lure of a devil

Lay bare how you really feel; 
I'm the world / I'm the law
Show me how you really feel! 
You're a bird at my mercy, prepare yourself
You say "No.1", 
you're my only one!

Are you ready, are you ready?
(Come here, challenger!)
Are you ready, are you ready?
(Hesitation's a no-no!!)
Are you ready, are you ready?
(Don't give up, how boring!)
Are you ready, are you ready?
(Hesitation's a no-no!!)

Roses have thorns, don't they? Sweet and painful
Are you ready, are you ready? 
A little scared
Make your pierced heart numb with excitement
Are you ready, are you ready? 
(Hesitation's a no-no!!)

I say "No.1", 
My love only one!

(Daring!! baby!)

Don't worry, don't worry!
(You're a challenger starting now?)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(No hesitation, Go go!!)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(Don't lose heart, how boring!)
Don't worry, don't worry!
(No hesitation, Go go!!)

Allow me to teach you the feel of an icy burn
Don't worry, don't worry! 
So, so passionate
Deeply in love, you want to know my serious answer
Don't worry, don't worry! 
(No hesitation, go, go!!)
