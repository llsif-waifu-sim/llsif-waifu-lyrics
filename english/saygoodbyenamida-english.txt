Scared of the day that's about to come,
I couldn't sleep again
And my face isn't its best color
I don't have much confidence
But if I give it my best shot, I'm sure I can tell you this

I could say I always felt this way about it all
But you were always willing to be kind to me
I relied so much on it; I wonder if I got a bit spoiled
So with my own feet, I must take the next step

You won't see me cry anymore
And I won't keep sighing
Until the day our dreams become true
The next tears I ever cry
I want it to be when we're together
It's time we see the best of it all
"I'm sorry I'm not very reliable," or things like that,
I'll never say them again, I never will 

It may be for only the smallest amount 
But I'm very certain
That my steps are going forward
If I was able to get this far alone
I know I won't be afraid of ever losing sight of my goal 

If I don't always keep in mind to believe in myself
Then who will left there to believe in me?
So I have to be more confidence and as always
At all times wear a bright smile
I am not sad anymore

No matter what ever happens for example
My heart won't ever fall apart
I'm looking only towards what's to come
Whatever happened before won't turn me around
And I'm bringing with me only my best thoughts
Even normal girls who don't feel special at all
Are able to change I'm sure of it

You won't see me cry anymore
And I won't keep sighing
Until the day our dreams become true
The next tears I ever cry
I want it to be when we're together
It's time we see the best of it all
"I'm sorry I'm not very reliable," or things like that,
I'll never say them again, I never will
