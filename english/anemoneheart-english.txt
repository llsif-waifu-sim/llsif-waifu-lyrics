Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I'm not a flower bud
Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I want to be picked

Longing for kindness, being hurt by kindness
I'd never wanted to experience these feelings,
I can't handle them

Your heart is so distant, I want to cry
But even so, I've decided I will wait
For you, my first love

Anemone heart, my lonely heart
The tears of a flower blooming alone
Gaze at me more, I'm right here
Anemone heart; Affection runs throughout my body
Someday, our loving heartbeats will meet

Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I'm not a flower bud
Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I want to be picked

Entrapped by the pain in my heart,
I embrace the pain
I've never stopped wishing
but you can't hear me, can you?
I want to monopolize you, I can't wait anymore
Let's believe in a dream which links us together,
my very first love

Acacia heart, my lonely heart
The language of flowers seems to hold secrets
Feel me more, I'm right here
Acacia heart; Drawn by excitement, I'm swept away
But, you see, I can't say it, I love you...
「I love you...」

Anemone heart, my lonely heart
The tears of a flower blooming alone
Gaze at me more, I'm right here
Anemone heart; Affection runs throughout my body
Someday, our loving heartbeats will meet

Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I'm not a flower bud
Lonely my love. lonely my heart
I want to be picked
