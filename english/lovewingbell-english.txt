The time has come to welcome the moment we’ve always waited for.
Is it okay for me to be feeling so much happiness?

This road we walk down, beckoned by the light,
Continues on to the future, brimming with hope.

Anyone can become cute? Yes, I know it’s possible!
Even someone like me… Transform!

So, I’ll give this to you. Cheer up! With our smiles just the way they are,
Let’s sing, let’s sing! I’ll give this to you. Cheer up!
Let’s stop worrying and look to our dreams.
If I’m with all of you, my beloved friends, new things are within my reach.
Let’s be reborn! From here, your world will grow even more.
Come on, I can see tomorrow!
Love wing… love wing…

I’m casting my hesitation off. Let’s straighten our backs and stand tall.
Oh, that’s nice. Now then, let’s just enjoy the wonders here.

The self that I never knew was bathed in light.
Even if it’s just for today, I want to be as brilliant as I can be.

Let’s all become cute! It’s definitely possible.
Just look, even I can… Transform!

Yes, that’s right, every girl will have her day to be a princess.
So happy, so happy, it’s just like magic.
Surprise brings forth the pulse of a dream.
Love is an important thing; it lets you do some wonderful things.
Let’s be reborn. Let’s go look for the next stage.
Now, what kind of ‘me’ shall I be tomorrow?
Love bell… love bell…

So, I’ll give this to you. Cheer up! With our smiles just the way they are,
Let’s sing, let’s sing! I’ll give this to you. Cheer up!
Let’s stop worrying and look to our dreams.
Love is an important thing; it lets you do some wonderful things.
Let’s be reborn. Let’s go look for the next stage.
