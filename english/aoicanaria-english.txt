The jade-green canary is shouting

I harboured them deep within my heart
The feelings with nowhere to go, and the painful way they'd suffocate me
For whose sake, and for what purpose?
Without any answers, I kept holding back, always

I'm cruelly tangled up in a thread my eyes can't see
Ah, the feelings that want to erupt are crying out
It doesn't matter if it's awkward, I want to be myself

My strong feelings are echoing even now, let me sing from my soul
Because I'm not, not, not, not the same me I was until yesterday
Spread the wings of freedom across the infinitely wide sky
The jade-green canary is shouting
