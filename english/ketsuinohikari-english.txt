Where's the distant world that I want?
When I stopped and looked up, that's when the path opened
In a blink of an eye, my heart started moving
I had a feeling that something was starting to change

Even if it's still a vague dream right now
Tomorrow will be different if I take a step forward

By tying my hair back up again to emit a jade green like glow
I'm going to move on without any hesitations
With an unbreakable bond in my heart, I will take this story to the next stage
Yes, this is where I'll start to shine

I'm trying to look for a world where everyone can be glad
As I met some expectations and some anxiety, they each changed to songs

I found one thing that I could only do
I'll keep on wishing as long as your voice echoes

Even if you're still far away from here
I'll spill my tears unknowingly until I reach someone

By tying my hair back up again to emit a jade green like glow
No matter how many times I stumble, I'll stand up for myself
With an unbreakable bond in my heart, on the stage spreading in front of you
I want to convey my feelings through a song

Even if itâ€™s still a vague dream right now
Tomorrow will be different if I take a step forward

Like a butterfly flying in the sky, causing a slight breeze from the wind
Until the day I push someone's back
If I confess without displaying anything from my heart
I'll keep shining

By tying my hair back up again to emit a jade green like glow
I'm going to move on without any hesitations
With an unbreakable bond in my heart, I will take this story to the next stage
Yes, this is where I'll start to shine
