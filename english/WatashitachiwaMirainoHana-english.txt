And so, we meet by chance...

A flower that wishes to face the sun
Everyone has a stalk within their heart, don't they?
Cherish each of them with care
Even now, a different path is waiting

I'll realise this dream and fly towards tomorrow
A beautiful dream called forth by our courage
Hey...I want to watch it together with you

Now, bloom! At the end of passionate hopes
Embark on a journey to meet your fate; Brilliance lies beyond the wind
Someday, the answer will come to you
So to not forget kindness, let's bloom

And so, the two of us meet by chance
Carrying red, bright red, large flowers
And so, the two of us meet by chance
The next time we meet, we'll be different people, yes?

Those who want to spread their roots into the ground
Dance in the wind, bodies blown around
As they are swayed, the paths each chose
simply extend into the distance

No need to say "I'll definitely come back," I already know
May our dream be strong; I'm certain about it
Hey...even I can see it!

You cry from the strong pain you came across
We've already bid farewell to yesterday; Anger is in the distance
Which direction should I face?
Let's go towards the places we felt such pain
Good-bye...

Now, bloom! At the end of passionate hopes
Embark on a journey to meet your fate; Brilliance lies beyond the wind
Someday, the answer will come to you
So to not forget kindness, let's bloom

And so, we will talk once again
Carrying red, bright red flowers of the future
And so, we will talk once again
The next time we meet, we'll be different people, yes?
Towards a new two we head...
