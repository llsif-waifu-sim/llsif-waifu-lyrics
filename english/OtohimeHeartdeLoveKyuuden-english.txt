Holding you tight, I'll never let go again
You're caught in the youngest princess' heart!

The blue sea hides a door waiting for love,
You know of such a rumor, right?
An eternal paradise

You've made your choice now
Don't run away
Let us both watch this sweet-sour dream together

This world of people will (soon, soon) change but
My wish will (never change)
I want to shake you more violently than the whirling tides

It's an ancient fairy tale, that within a legendary palace
A gentleman who fell in love
Could never return (it was told)
Tonight's story, will revive that legend
I'm certain you've fallen in love
That's right, you've come just for me
Forget everything else, let us sway and dance

Let's decorate using this red coral, like the flame of love
Maybe it's the color of jealousy
An eternal prison


You've made your choice now
Don't run away
Let us both watch this unending dream together

It's love, right? It's love! Dreaming and burning in the waves



This world of people will (soon, soon) change but
My wish will (never change)
I want to shake you and tie you down more violently than the whirling tides

It's an ancient fairy tale, that within a legendary palace
A gentleman who fell in love
Could never return (it was told)
Tonight's story, will revive that legend
I'm certain you've fallen in love
That's right, you've come just for me
Forget everything else, let us sway and dance
Forget everything else...!

Holding you tight, I'll never let go again
You're caught in the youngest princess' heart!
Holding you tight, I'll never, never let you go again
You're caught in the youngest princess' heart!
