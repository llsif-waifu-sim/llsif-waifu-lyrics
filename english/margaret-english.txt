I look in the mirror and ask myself:
"As who I am right now, do I look adorable?"
I still haven't received an answer yet

So that I can keep up even more smiles than anybody else
I have to be the cutest I can be today, too
Thinking about it all alone in my room

Although this is my true face
Could you like it even more?

Please listen!
I want you to see me when I'm sad and happy
Even the strange faces I have sometimes, please laugh them off and forgive them

Because you've always cared for me 
I want to be number one for you
I've put all my feelings into this song

And will continue to work 
Even harder for you 

Just like a balloon I feel my head starts to swell up
I feel I can't stop myself from trembling all over
It's nothing like me don't you think?

It's the first time I feel like that
My chest ever so slightly feels tight

Please listen!
Even if I told you everything about me please don't ever part ways with me 
I've come to get something I love more
Than everything I've cherished before

I'm so sorry for making you see me 
Hidden this much behind a veil
But by all and any means I want to connect with you
With this Special Margaret

Please listen!
I want you to see me when I'm sad and happy
Even the strange faces I have sometimes, please laugh them off and forgive them

Because you've always cared for me 
I want to be number one for you
I've put all my feelings into this song

And will continue to work 
Even harder for you
