Maze Town...

Even tonight, the moonlight glares into the darkness
The clock's hands tremble at midnight
I can see that you've arrived. Hiding behind that heavy door,
Waiting for the right moment

We'll always be connected
But there's no forever
Who decided that?
Let's believe we can
Jump over time and life

Maze Town Maze Town
There's no going back
Many souls continue to wander
I want to protect them through thousands of years of wind and rain
Maze Town, no matter how dark it is
We'll continue to move forward into a future that we have yet to see
So that these precious things aren't broken
I listen to the sound of footsteps
Who, who, who is there?
