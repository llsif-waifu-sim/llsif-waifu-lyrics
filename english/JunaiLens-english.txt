Believe in it... the moment when your heart was throbbing
Believe in it... your pure love lens is right

Get closer, *thump thump* charge forward!
With my rule, *thump thump* charge forward!

What's the problem? Are you having an unrequited love?
Why don't I help you out with this wondrous power

What's your real intention? Is it no good unless it's him?
Then close your eyes, and gently whisper his name

Let us pray for your sake
For your feelings to be granted as high as possible

Believe in it... the moment when your heart was throbbing
Because you see, encounters aren't by choice but coincidences
Believe in it... I was cut by your pure love lens
His dazzling smile is the best
I can feel the strength of your feelings... I'll cheer for you!

Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
With my rule, *ton ton* Let's go
Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
If you like him, put in effort to get closer!

I can counsel you too, you know? You cried because of your first love?
I will encourage you with this special power

Is this really okay? You wish to forget all about him?
Open your eyes, and let out your wish once more

Receive this formless power,
The power to achieve victory from here on

Waiting... But just this is an unmoving love
No matter which you choose, the situation will change right?
Waiting... Rather than that, wouldn't you take the leap
You've succeeded in gaining his attention
To convey the strength of your feelings... Let's practice that!

Take a photo *pa pa pa pachin*
With my lens *pa pa pa* Let's go
Take a photo *pa pa pa pachin*
I want your pure love to bear fruit!

Believe in it... this moment when your heart is throbbing
Believe in it... your pure love lens is right
Believe in it... this moment when your heart is throbbing
Because you see, encounters aren't by choice but coincidences
Believe in it... I was cut by your pure love lens
His dazzling smile is the best
I can feel the strength of your feelings... I'll cheer for you!

Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
With my rule, *ton ton* Let's go
Get closer, *ton ton* charge forward
If you like him, put in effort to get closer!
