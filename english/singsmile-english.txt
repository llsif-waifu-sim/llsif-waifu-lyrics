Going back home even in the same route as always
A familiar city if I'm with you
It becomes a totally different place

Even if everyone is totally different one another
All of those colors if we mix them to one
It'll make the paint to a beautiful tomorrow

More('till when we'll fly away?)
More, if you shout for it as it is
It's fine no matter when
You're not alone, we are with you
Making sound to this harmony

Into the world of dreams (At any time)
I will make way (I will make way)
If you bring forth from your heart a smile you will see
Anytime to laugh is a chance!
To start along a shining story

Let's hold hands (At any time)
Even if for a moment(I will make way)
I will not let it go of this dream I drew for us
Serving myself with this song
I will tell to you happy smile

Not always everything is going to work out for us
Even if we fail we should not put our heads down
As tomorrow shall be more bright than before

More ('till when we'll fly away?)
More, let's make it more exciting
All of these miracles that come together
Go across the sky and become stars
Delivering this harmony

Into a future fantasy (At any time)
Let's run together (Let's aim for it)
If you trust the heartbeat that resides in your heart
The important things, oh my friend
Will come to be at your side and that it's you!

An irreplaceable (At any time)
Moment (We should aim for)
We should hold tight of this hope we share
And with a unmistakable voice
I will tell to you happy life

If we sing together wo wo wo
We will enjoy together wo wo wo
We will sing for a hallelujah tomorrow!

Into the world of dreams (at any time)
I will make way (I will make way)
If you bring forth from your heart a smile you will see
Anytime to laugh is a chance!
To start along a shining story

Let's hold hands (at any time)
Even if for a moment(I will make way)
I will not let it go of this dream I drew for us
Serving myself with this song
I will tell to you happy smile
Serving myself with this song
I will tell to you happy smile
