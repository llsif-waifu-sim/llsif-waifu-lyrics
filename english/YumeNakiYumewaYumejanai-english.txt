Running through the wind
You’re running again today
My eyes follow as you sweat on the school grounds

No matter how far I’ll notice at any time
“Do your best! Don’t get crushed!”
My heart shouts out

If you’re serious a chance will come
You have to catch it
Before the throbbing in your chest disappears

Look, I say fight! For your sake
I’ll push your back with a smile
Become number one, It will be you!
I say fight! That’s my cheer
You’re still on fire
So definitely don’t give up
A dreamless dream isn't a dream

Raindrops are glittering
Glittering on your face
I want to wipe the dirt off the ball

Even on days like this you have to bring out all of your spirit
“Do your best! Stand firm!”
I’ll embrace you with all my heart

You’re serious, The sparkle in your eyes
Looks dazzling
The flames of battle rage

Now, I wish you to fight! I’ll push your back
Toward whatever you face
I can see number one, It will be you!
I wish you to fight! That’s my cheer
I’ll protect you without fail
No matter how formidable the foe
Your dreams will be victorious, They can be victorious

Look, I say fight! For your sake
I’ll push your back with a smile
Become number one, It will be you!
I say fight! That’s my cheer
You’re still on fire
So definitely don’t give up
A dreamless dream isn't a dream
