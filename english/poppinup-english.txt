Knock! Knock! My chest
Pop! Pop! Popping up!
Knock! Knock! Is jumping
Knock! Knock! My dreams
Pop! Pop! Popping up!
Are starting to get excited

At any given time (Let's get excited!)
360 degrees, no matter where I go
I want to show you the moment (Let's get hyped!)
That I burst, on an almost cellular level

Even if I sometimes (Crying Crying) 
End up looking down on myself (Trying Trying)
It's at times like this (Keep on smiling)
That I want to stay cute for even just a second longer

Let it reach you! Let it reach you!
To the farthest ends of the Earth
Resonate! Resonate! (Yes! Super cutie smile)
The twinkling of my color is constantly overflowing
And that's why I'm smiling
There's only one sparkle that's more unique
If I believe in it, I'll always Make My Way!!

Knock! Knock! My dreams
Pop! Pop! Popping up!
Are starting to get excited

Of course, I'll still smile (Check! Check! Let's do it!)
Even if my face is troubled or sly
I want to pursue perfection (Let's take a selfie!)
On a more professional-based level 

I'm evolving (Updating)
More than I was the day before (Growing Growing)
"I just want to be cute" (Keep on saying)
Because cuteness just saves this world

Let it reach you! Let it reach you!
As we wake up from this sensation
Resonate! Resonate! (Yes! Super cutie smile)
My heart is dyed with my color
But I'll smile as it's over
There's only one sparkle that's more unique
If I go through it, I'll always Love My Way!!

Anytime, at any place
(Anytime Anyway Every day)
I'm just being myself...
(Good day Bad day Every day)
Absolute CONFIDENCE
I want it...
Someday!
Oh, please look down on me, God

Let it arrive, let it arrive
To the farthest ends of the sky
Find it, find it
It's here somewhere

Let it reach you! Let it reach you!
To the farthest ends of the Earth
Resonate! Resonate! (Yes! Super cutie smile)
The twinkling of my color is constantly overflowing
And that's why I'm smiling
There's only one sparkle that's more unique
If I believe in it, I won't give up
Yes, there's only one shine that's more unique
I'll keep going on and Make My Way!!
