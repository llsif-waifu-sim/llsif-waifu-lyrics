A summer of wanting to see you; This year's summer
is a story between you and me
So don't run, don't be afraid
When we gaze into each other's eyes, storm in lover

I won't stop; Why not say it?
Whoever looks away first is the loser
I won't stop anymore
Just the two of us on the beach, I want to love you fervidly

Yes! No! Say yes!
Accept all of my passion turning to love
Yes! No! Say yes!
Your heart will surely give me your answer

A summer of wanting to see you; This year's summer
I feel like I'm going to melt, 'cause of you
My whole body's calling out, calling out to you
Don't leave me; You are my love

A summer of wanting to see you; This year's summer
is a story between you and me
So don't run, don't be afraid
When we gaze into each other's eyes, storm in lover

I won't go home; That's what I want to say
To embarrass you, excite you...is that mean?
Hey, I won't go home; The rhythm of the waves
urges you to embrace me

Yes! No! Say yes!
Once swept away by the the passion of falling in love
Yes! No! Say yes!
The true me will awaken, and our sweet summer will begin

As we dance boldly in the sunset,
I want to share an extreme dream with you
My whole body's calling out, calling out to you
This must be fate; You are my love

As we dance boldly in the sunset,
your heart-swaying perfume tempts me
So please don't run, please don't be afraid
Love is a storm; Storm in Lover

Yes! No! Say yes!
Accept all of my passion turning to love
Yes! No! Say yes!
Your heart will surely give me your answer

A summer of wanting to see you; This year's summer
I feel like I'm going to melt, 'cause of you
My whole body's calling out, calling out to you
Don't leave me; You are my love

A summer of wanting to see you; This year's summer
is a story between you and me
So don't run, don't be afraid
When we gaze into each other's eyes, storm in lover
Love is a storm; Storm in Lover
