The white moon is floating alone in the night sky
And shining softly in the window
Drinking with you at a cafe after school
It has the sweet taste of milk tea

Everyday and night, I get those thoughts
Anywhere anytime, I want to meet you
You're always on my mind until the next time
I can't wait any longer for that promised moment...

Beautiful Moonlight
For a moment I say goodbye
I've come to deeply miss your voice
All by myself tasting
Something that's slightly bittersweet
Good night my moonlight
Look after me all night
Even when my eyes are closed, I still see your face
Even in my dreams I want to see you, ah

Why are the times I spend with you
The ones that seem to pass the fastest
The sun is setting and I have to go home
But we barely make it under the time limit

The way back home my heart hurts
Walking so slow won't help, won't help
Wanna be with you more even if for a second
If I could just stop time...

Beautiful Moonlight
I don't want to say goodbye
When we part ways, I feel so lonely
When we're divided by this distance
I think I feel a bit sad
There's still some moonlight
Please don't change to a red light
The figure I said goodbye to is getting smaller
I wish I could always be with you

A love-colored milk tea
The aftertaste always lingers
Melty and Sweet
I want to fly into the sky with you now

Beautiful Moonlight
For a moment I say goodbye
I've come to deeply miss your voice
All by myself tasting
Something that's slightly bittersweet
Good night my moonlight
Look after me all night
Even when my eyes are closed, I still see your face
Even in my dreams I want to see you, ah
