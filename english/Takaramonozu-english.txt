Now, where will our smiles take us?
Think of where you want to go
Hurry, let's go!

Having fun could be the key to using your heart
Brush away all of the things you don't like
Yes, let's go!

Look up to the sky, and your tears will seem to fade away
Come on, come on, come on, here's a hint!

We've discovered treasures right here and now
Lots of them; they're everyone's smiles
The treasures we've discovered
Here are our overwhelming dreams, show me more and more of them!

Courage is important, so let's hurry and go!
Wish for it with all your might
Right now, let's go!

Let's use our frustration too; we'll turn it into something positive
When things get unbearable, it's okay to be a bit selfish
It's fine, so let's go!

Our love grants an unbeatable power
Grab it, grab it, grab it, reach for it!

No one knows about these treasures yet
They're all searching for them, yes, everyone's trying hard
These undiscovered treasures
Are so close, yet so far, they'll never stop shining

We've discovered treasures right here and now
Lots of them; they're everyone's smiles
The treasures we've discovered
Here are our overwhelming dreams, show me more and more of them!
