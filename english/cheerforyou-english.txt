A pair of cheeks tinted pink
Indicate a sense of newfound love
Like a big round balloon
Your heart expands and there's no stopping to it

Those feeling you entrusted to me
Twirling and fluttering around
Turning around aiming for the blue sky fly away Go!

Starting to like someone
Is a really wonderful thing isn't it?
Going to deliver that famed "I love you"
Don't hesitate for a moment and be straightforward
And then express to them all of those feelings 
Because as long as you have me by your side
You will have courage! Cheer for you!!

You look a bit sad what happened?
I can sense a need to call SOS
As it is something I've never felt before
I'm a bit scared and confused

Those feeling entrust them to me
Tell me all of them
Even if the day's cloudy go beyond fly away Go!

Always thinking of that someone
Is a really wonderful thing isn't it?
Being that deeply important to you
That person can also be thinking alike
For this future that comes I predict big happiness
If you wait to do it that's alright
Bring out your courage! Cheer for you!!

Your heart overflowing with that "I love you"
In that way use it to ride your balloon
Let's fly Go!

Starting to like someone
Is a really wonderful thing isn't it?
Going to deliver that famed "I love you"
With that special person you have to be clear

Always thinking of that someone
Is a really wonderful thing isn't it?
Being that deeply important to you
That person can also be thinking alike
For this future that comes I predict big happiness
If you wait to do it that's alright
Bring out your courage! Cheer for you!!
