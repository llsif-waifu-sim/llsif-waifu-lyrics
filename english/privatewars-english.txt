Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!
Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!

Yeah, are you leaving?
I’m not gonna chase after you
Basically, I hate creating crowds

I’m someone who understands the pain of loneliness
Sometimes we trade words
and think of each other at our own places
Boosting up each other’s day

What’cha do what’cha do? I do “Private Wars”
Hey, get a hold of justice and be sly
What’cha do what’cha do? I do “Private Wars”
Hey, life’s got a bit of courage and passion, doesn't it?

Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!
Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!

Oh, are you quitting already?
You've got no patience at all
Ah… So you don’t really want it

Getting serious is tough, but rather than complaining about it
I want to run without breaking a sweat
I won’t ask for favors, nor will I give up
So beautifully, super action please

What’cha do what’cha do? I know “Dangerous Wars”
Just being some saintly girl isn’t my thing
What’cha do what’cha do? I know “Dangerous Wars”
Just throwing in the towel on life counts as retreating, doesn't it?

Let me rush through this boring and Bad world
I don’t want to act according to plans

What’cha do what’cha do? I do “Private Wars”
Hey, get a hold of justice and be sly
What’cha do what’cha do? I do “Private Wars”
Hey, life’s got a bit of courage and passion, doesn't it?

Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!
Can I do? I take it, baby! Can I do? I make it, baby!
