Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Let me do!


Party shocking party, are you ready to get started?
(Come here, right over here)
Party shocking party, the world is turning
(Come here, right over here)

It’s for nobody else (Me and my freedom)
Because it’s all up to you (Go, go! we are freedom)
It’s 'cause of nobody else (My soul is free)
You’re the protagonist you know? You understand?

I want to know more, of this excessive life
Let’s delve into the dreams
I want to know more, of this excessive life
So let’s have a shocking party

Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Let me do!


Venus! Charming Venus!! Shall we head on while fighting?
(Look here, look right now)
Venus! Charming Venus!! I'll seize the world
(Look here, look right now)

My confidence shows my real intentions (Lonely passion)
Leaving it to someone else is no good (Go, go! we had passion)
My confidence shows my seriousness (Dangerous passion)
Everyone else is unrelated to this you know? You understand?

I want to give more, of my unique love
But before the moon vanishes,
I want to give more, of my unique love
Feel & touch... Charming Venus!!

It’s for nobody else (Me and my freedom)
Because it’s all up to you (Go, go! we are freedom)
It’s 'cause of nobody else (My soul is free)
You’re the protagonist you know? You understand?

I want to know more, of this excessive life
Let’s delve into the dreams
I want to know more, of this excessive life
So let’s have a shocking party

Dancing, dancing!　You're dancing too!

I want to know more, of this excessive life
Let’s delve into the dreams
I want to know more, of this excessive life
So let’s have a shocking party

Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Non-stop my dancing
Dancing, dancing! Let me do!
