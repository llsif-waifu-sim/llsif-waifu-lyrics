I see the ends of the sky
And also the distant world that nobody knows about
The small stars shine
Surely in the same night sky

So don’t forget
In just a short amount of time
Miracles are engraved by the heart
Gently waiting for tomorrow

Tender wishes (from kindness)
Wavering thoughts… That’s right…
It’s not only gently being by your side
Change is beginning. Do you understand?

Fragments of a dream shake the wings
Once again becoming a lovely song
They want to shine within that light
Spread your wings and heat up this evening

Because I always want to rescue you
Because I want to support you, let’s give it my all
If I think "I am able to do anything"
I will become strong

Gentle and yet (kind)
Delicate… That’s right…
Let’s go towards the important things sooner
Little by little when I get closer

Drops of a dream soak the wings
Just tightly embrace this moment
If this light doesn't go out
Spread your wings and let’s protect this evening

That’s right, the power of hope will surely transmit through our overlapping hands
Now, within the quiet slumber
Tomorrow will be reborn, ah surely…

Fragments of a dream shake the wings
Once again becoming a lovely song
They want to shine within that light
Spread your wings and heat up this evening

What rose from those pair of trembling wings?
Spread your wings and let’s protect this evening
