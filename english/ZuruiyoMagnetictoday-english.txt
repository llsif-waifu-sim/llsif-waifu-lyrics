Are you looking at me? Don’t look at me!
Wanna wanna wanna, it’s a trap!
Are you an ally? Or are you an enemy?
Wanna wanna wanna, it’s a trap!

(Why are you always looking at me?)
(You’re always looking at me too aren't you!)
(I'm only looking at you because you looked at me first!)
(See! So you WERE looking!)

No way, you ran into me again today? Are you telling me it's a coincidence?
Or is it all part of your plan? How suspicious!
(Idiot!) You're overthinking this too much (But you know!) How can I not?
Are you looking at me? Don’t look at me! 
Yeah... I knew it...

I should try and talk to her; At this rate,
I’m going to keep worrying whether she’s an ally or an enemy

It’s not fair, it’s not fair, you’re hiding your true intentions
See! Our eyes just met again!
It’s not fair, it’s not fair, you’re hiding your true intentions and it’s captivating me
Ahh, your magnetism just isn’t fair! (Are you looking at me?) (Don’t look at me!)


Aren’t you coming here? Come here!
Doki Doki Doki, your motives are dishonest!
Are you hoping to be good friends? Or do you wish to be rivals?
Doki Doki Doki, your motives are dishonest!

Maybe tomorrow, I'll smile at you honestly
So I've decided, but I feel hesitant... How strange!
(It's awful) this personality you put on (But I only have) this kind of personality
Aren’t you coming here? Come here!
Hey... When I think about it...

We might be alike (How, exactly?) Like our composure?
Hoping to be good friends, wishing to be rivals, it's just on my mind

I know, I know, you're hiding your serious side
It's scary to become entranced
I know, I know, you're hiding your serious side and it's captivating me
Ahh, magnetic today!! (Aren’t you coming here?) (Come here!)


It’s not fair, it’s not fair, you’re hiding your true intentions
See! Our eyes just met again!
It’s not fair, it’s not fair, you’re hiding your true intentions and it’s captivating me
Ahh, your magnetism just isn’t fair!
I know, I know, you're hiding your serious side
It's scary to become entranced
I know, I know, you're hiding your serious side and it's captivating me
Ahh, magnetic today!! (Hey, so what are we going to do?) (Hurry up and decide!)

Are you looking at me? Don’t look at me!
Wanna wanna wanna, it’s a trap!
Are you an ally? Or are you an enemy?
Wanna wanna wanna, it’s a trap!
