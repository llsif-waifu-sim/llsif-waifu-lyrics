Three, two, one, zero! Here's my intro
Please look at me; I'm completely serious
My thrilling beauty will win, without fail

I whisper gentle words
I'm not just pretending to be cute
I have to coldly, strongly protect
those precious to me, and those weak

Who am I, yes? You've grown curious, yes?
Then it might just be love
Knowing secrets lie hidden in my heart,
What will you do about that?
It's soldier game
Will you ask about them next time we meet?

Three, two, one, zero! Onto the next battle strategy
Please look at me; I'm completely serious
Receive my signal and the future will be yours

Sweeter than a smile
Are tears brought about from a lie
Hiding transience and fragileness,
You're someone precious, someone weak

You'll come with me, yes? You've grown curious about my touch, yes?
Then it's already love
Since you're someone I must meet in battle someday,
That might just be your reason
I'm soldier heart
I won't lose, okay? It's soldier game

(Come on!)

It's a duel now!
Who am I, yes? You've grown curious, yes?
Then it might just be love
Knowing secrets lie hidden in my heart,
what will you do about that?

You'll come with me, yes? You've grown curious about my touch, yes?
Then it's already love
Since you're someone I must meet in battle someday,
That might just be your reason
It's soldier game
Though we've met again, I'm soldier heart
