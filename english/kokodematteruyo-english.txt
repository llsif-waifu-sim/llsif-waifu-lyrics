It’s dyed by the sunset
This somewhat lonely scene
 The usual chitchat goes on
I feel that “normal is the best”

“Don’t ever change!”
I wonder if that is selfish of me
“Be nice to no one but me”
Just kidding… that was just a joke

“Welcome back, how was it?”
I’ll try talking about today’s various things
“Don’t be worried, okay?”
Because I don’t want you to suddenly disappear
“Welcome back, was it fun?”
I’m in the mood to hear today’s funny stories
“The wind is a bit chilly today, isn't it?”
Let’s prepare some things to keep us warm!

So hey... therefore, so hey... probably
I will wait for you right here

One by one, the shining stars
Bring with them the uneasiness of times like this
I want to brush it all off
But I unconsciously let the cold words overflow

“You won’t ever change, right?”
I will start wanting to push all my concerns onto you
I’m full of uneasiness
Somehow… I feel it even from a distant place

I send you off with both hands quivering
But then I realized how high you've risen
Because looking at your retreating figure
You turn around and wave goodbye one more time

“Welcome back, how was it?”
I’ll try talking about today’s various things
“I’m worried, I really am”
Because I don’t want you to suddenly disappear
“Hey, did you encounter anything fun?”
If so, show me and make me laugh
“The wind is a bit chilly today”
Let’s prepare some things to keep us warm!

I will always be waiting here
“Welcome back!”
