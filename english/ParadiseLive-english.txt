Three, two, one, live!

Dance party, dance party
It's almost time for the farewell parade
Jump into the air with a shout, "Let's go!" (Jumpin' jumpin' high!)

Dance party, dance party
We'll meet again, though
Don't forget about my melody (Don't forget me!)

Together, say yeah yeah yeah! You too, say yeah yeah yeah!
We'll happily shout out
Together, say yeah yeah yeah! You too, say yeah yeah yeah!
We'll have a Paradise Live (Three, two, three, two, one, live!)

Farewell, farewell, but we'll surely meet again soon
Promise me that you'll wait for me until then (Yes!)
Farewell, farewell, but we'll surely meet again
Until then, I'll do my very best to show you an even brighter smile
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I love you! I love you! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
I'll shout even louder, "I love you!"

Don't worry, don't worry
I want to experience excitement
I hope tomorrow will make my heart race (Searchin' searchin' heart!)

Don't worry, don't worry
There's still room for our strength to grow
No one can stop our melody (All together!)

My heart is on fire, yeah yeah yeah!
We're shining as we burn bright
My heart is on fire, yeah yeah yeah!
It'll be an amazing Paradise Live (Three, two, three, two, one, live!)

Let's go to make our next dream come true
Hurry, don't look back, I want to move forward (Yes!)
We're on a journey to make our next dream come true
I'll work hard to leap towards that world
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I need you! I need you! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
In this vast world, "I need you!"

Let's go to make our next dream come true
Hurry, don't look back, I want to move forward (Yes!)
We're on a journey to make our next dream come true
I'll work hard to leap towards that world
Farewell, farewell, but we'll surely meet again soon
Promise me that you'll wait for me until then (Yes!)
Farewell, farewell, but we'll surely meet again
Until then, I'll do my very best to show you an even brighter smile
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I love you! I love you! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh baby, I'm goin' now! Goin' now! Yeah! Yeah!
I'll shout even louder, "I love you!"
