Doing your best is for yourself
That’s so tiring
Let’s embrace someone else’s smile
Let’s create the future together

People who can do it all
Are the heroes in all our dreams
Dreams are fun while dreaming
You won’t do everything in a flash, You won’t do everything perfectly
I want you to take care of yourself as well

A little bit of courage
Will illuminate my heart, Do you know? (Lovely)
Sparkle, Can I do! (Find it)
It’s a true miracle (You-see-Do-your-best!)

Hey-you
Maybe the method for doing your best is different?
Don’t keep worries to yourself
Becoming sad is no fun
Doing your best is for yourself
That’s so tiring
Let’s embrace someone else’s smile
Let’s create the future together

I received a shock as we passed each other
Rather than fortune wasn’t it through great effort?
If you accept that the impossible is impossible
I’m sure you’ll be able to, You’ll be able to do it perfectly
Perhaps you’ll be able to take more punishment than today

With a little bit of courage I’ll fly too
Lead the way, Can you hear? (Without fail)
Be enthusiastic, Do I do! (Search)
I’m really waiting (Here-goes-Don’t-give-up!)

Here-goes
Don’t give up, Beyond our destination
Is the blue sky after the rain
The droplets burst out in sparkles
You won’t give up, right? Beyond the fog
Is a brilliant new world so
Leave behind all the weariness and let’s go
Let’s move forward gently and strongly

Hey-you
Maybe the method for doing your best is different?
Don’t keep worries to yourself
Becoming sad is no fun
Doing your best is for yourself
That’s so tiring
Being together is great, I want to keep smiling
Sympathy of smiles

Here-goes
Don’t give up, Beyond our destination
Is the blue sky after the rain
The droplets burst out in sparkles
You won’t give up, right? Beyond the fog
Is the warm light of a new world
Leave behind all the weariness and let’s go
Let’s move forward gently and strongly, Let’s move forward!
