μ’sic forever!
Don't forget, our footprints

We made it here with the power we believed in
The future we can see is definitely the same
It's a treasure, all the times we shared
I want to say "Thank you", a friend of my heart!

(μ'sic) From the very start
This meeting was a miracle, I knew that all along
(μ'sic) Everyone's feelings
If we link them all it definitely won't end, Let's do more and more fun things

La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on, and convey our joy just like that
We'll become one with our smiles
La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on; Time, please let tonight continue on forever
Ah... how about it?

Being surprised at the world unfolding before us
Let's hold hands and continue advancing and running
It's exhilarating, and so will be the coming days
I want to say "Please take care of me" to you.... friend!!

(μ'sic) Gradually growing stronger
This meeting was a miracle, I felt that all along
(μ'sic) Everyone's feelings
If we link them all it definitely won't end, come on let's watch our fun dreams

La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, while bathing in the power of this light
I want to hold these memories close with everyone while smiling
La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, could you please call out loudly? I want to play
Ah... This moment is everything!

μ’sic forever!
Don't forget, our footprints
La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on, we're all linked by our joy
I want to say "Thank you"... yeah!
La-La μ'sical night!
Let's dance on, who shall we make our wishes to?
Time please stop (Time please stop) We're all full of happy smiles
La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, while bathing in the power of this light
I want to hold these memories close with everyone while smiling
La-La μ'sical sign!
Let's sing, could you please call out loudly? I want to play
Ah... This moment is everything!

μ’sic forever!
Don't forget, our footprints
