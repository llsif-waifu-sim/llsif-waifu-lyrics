A mystery always opens a different place after solving it
Let’s solve this mystery after another one and so on, let’s play
Escape and Search on mind

I can’t advance without closing off a wish, don’t be shy, just listen
One person can’t see all the clues
If we’re together I know, I know
That voice of light in the darkness, I’ll call it your voice
If you believe it should be connected, with a light like a miracle

We are going ‘round and ‘round 
My heart is getting hotter

I am looking at you, reflect me in your eyes
Look at me and your heart wants to give out loud beats
This mystery, if it continues, will turn into excitement
Escape and Search on mind

At the time we wished the game to start,
A dazzling future is what I’m hoping for
You can call it an adventure, it’s like love,
Like the thrill of a never-ending roller coaster
Darkness is the real deal, I think it’s gonna emerge
I believe it is connected, with a miracle-like light

Inviting us to be closer to the answer
It’s an instinctive thing that makes us feel,
Even... hotter!

A mystery always opens a different place after solving it
I’m waiting for you to quickly say “I found it”
Let’s solve this mystery after another one and so on, let’s play

There are still a lot of things I don’t know,
However I still have to go on ahead
I have to make sure that nothing ever changes

When you solve the mystery,
You're not alone

I am looking at you, reflect me in your eyes
Look at me and your heart wants to give out loud beats
This mystery, if it continues, will turn into excitement, so let’s play
Escape and Search on mind
