The whistle that will signal the beginning will be blown soon
In a split second, my heart's switch turns on: I'm getting fired up
Now, this is my body's evolution! Look at this revolution!
I won't be stopped! 

I'm getting a lot of support for running, running, running
It's all my power for the future, as everyone runs even faster
I'm decided this is my evolution! Give me that revolution!
I won't be stopped! I can't be stopped!

What do you like to dream about?
They should come true when we meet
Once they spread far and wide,
We'll laugh because there's so many

But it'll be the best laugh ever
