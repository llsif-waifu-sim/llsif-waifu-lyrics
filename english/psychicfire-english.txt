Correct your prejudices!
I won't say things like that 
I wandered around searching for the things I like, just the things I like, and then
Where am I? Where is this again? 
An unrecognizable street corner
Nationality unknown (Huh?) Age untold (No!) The gamblers gathered here (Nico too!)

The blue building's lights take the night to the future 
Changing completely, a suspicious illusion (I don't get what you mean~)

PSYCHIC FIRE everybody everybody GO! (fu! fu!)
Inside my head it's PICA PICARESQUE (wu~ wu~ wu~ wu)
I wanna have a dangerous love (fu! fu!) My heart's flame is burning (Ah~ hi! hi! hi! hi)
I'm calling to you, I want to connect with you...notice me! 



Try acting on your whims!
And then I run away
The system that makes things you want to do come true just by wanting to do them
Is it a phantom? A delusion?
An unnatural townscape 
Existence unknown (Nico!) Analysis impossible (Maki!) A juggler that sells dreams (Elichika!)

I drilled into these thick walls, please open the door 
Don't agree with this deceptive solution (Harasho!)

PSYCHIC DARLING what kind of what kind of LOVE! (fu! fu!)
Being forgetful is ROMA ROMANESQUE (wu~ wu~ wu~ wu)
No matter how many times, I wanna fall in love (fu! fu!) My body is electric and  (Ah~ BiBiBiBiBiBiBiBi) 
Charging up, I'm searching for you right now...did you notice?
