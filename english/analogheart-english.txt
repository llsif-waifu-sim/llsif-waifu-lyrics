Beep bee-beep bee-bee-beep beep boop beep boop
Analog heart

Before I knew it
I was wa-wa-walking somewhere far away
I unpredictably made a bi-bi-big jump
As if I was in a dream

Being updated every day
Is sti-sti-stimulating
Your smile won’t be hidden anymore
I want to see it with my own eyes

I want to reach out
To anyone, anywhere
Even if it’s rainy or windy
My analog heart is still strong

In order to access the future, let’s connect
The courage that jumps out will be a success
Our hearts are all online
Beep bee-beep bee-bee-beep beep boop beep boop
It’s okay, it’s okay to make a mistake
We just need one more step in order to clear this level
Unlock the password of your heart
Your connected analog heart
Your precious analog heart
