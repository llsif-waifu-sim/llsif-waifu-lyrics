I sigh, alone on the beach
As I continue to recall your smile
My sighs linger in the air
Even after all this time, my heart still hurts
When summer ended, my love ended as well (Farewell)

Every day with you was so miraculously fun
When did the autumn breeze begin to blow?

If only I could see you one more time (I know I can't)
I wish my love could reach you
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef

I can't return to those exciting days
During that season, all of the time spent awake was precious
We embraced that excitement
As we walked together, on and on
When summer ended, our love disappeared as well (Farewell)

I believed that our happiness would continue on forever
So why did you leave me behind?

Those memories are already far, far away (A beautiful dream)
Even though my love hasn't changed
Those memories are already far, far away...
Love is a mirage that will disappear eventually

I won't forget the heat from the white sand, or the color of your tanned skin
They'll become precious memories (They will, they will)
But even so, these tears will never dry up

If only I could see you one more time (I know I can't)
I wish my love could reach you
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef
(Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...)
(Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...)
