(Yay! Yay! Let's go everyone!)

(Come on, Come on, Wonderland!
A happy Wonderland for everyone!)

Hey do you hear it? An impatient heartbeat
Let's go make a cute kingdom together
We'll use some of this and some of that
to fill this world with luxuries

Sometimes there are also frustrating things
But piece by piece I will reveal it
Thanks to your help it will always be exciting

The best Wonderland in all of the world
I want to someday take you there
The happiness and smiles won't ever stop!

Sing alongside Kasumin
And you'll find yourself with an irreplaceable treasure
Welcome to the super cute Wonderland!

Although this is a future we don't know
If we step into it, we'll see it clearly
It will make your dreams gleam and sparkle
It's a heaven filled with it to the brim!

Even if it may confuse you a bit
Worrying is a no-no! That is a given!
Let's blow everything away with this songâ˜†

The best Wonderland in all of the world
I want to someday build it with you
And fill the whole place of happiness and smiles!

Aim to achieve it along Kasumin
A light that spreads further and higher than now
Welcome to the popping super cute Wonderland!

As this melody spreads around
Isn't being full of happiness the best?

The best Wonderland in all of the world
I want to someday take you there
The happiness and smiles will be unforgettable

Sing alongside Kasumin
And you'll find yourself with an irreplaceable treasure
Welcome to the super cute Wonderland!
