It's a magical
Are miracles inviting this coincidence?
The fact that we met, the fact that we met, is an amazing fate

It's a magical
The shooting stars are our allies
Let's make a wish! Let's make a wish! For a miracle tomorrow

Dancing stars on me!
If we reach our arms out
One day, we will be able to get there
That is why that beautiful, shining sky at the end
Is our goal... It's our goal!

Let us dance even more, even more
All of us, all of us won't stop
We're magicians just for today — What sort of dreams might we see?
Let us dance even more, even more
All of us, all of us won't stop
Our tears are the diamonds of youth, the light that adorns you

I'm in fantasy
Skip across the night sky
Wherever we go, wherever we go, let's go to a place we like

I'm in fantasy
I'm whispering to the twinkling stars
I want to move forward! I want to move forward! No matter when

Shining milky way!
Even when we're uneasy
Let's face forward and laugh!
That's right, the clouds of sorrow we want to blow away
We don't need them... we don't need them!

All this time, I've been searching
The way I really am
Today, for sure, we're magicians — What sort of dreams can we grant?
All this time, I've been searching
The way I really am
Let's travel through our youth with bare feet, a journey that excites our hearts

Let us dance even more, even more
All of us, all of us won't stop
We're magicians just for today — What sort of dreams might we see?
Let us dance even more, even more
All of us, all of us won't stop
Our tears are the diamonds of youth, the light that adorns you
