Let's get along, everyone!
I love you! Because I'm Ai!
Everybody are you ready?

There's seriously no way I can stand every day being boring (NG!)
If you feel bored can't you just do something fun? (That's ok!)
If you're looking down, you can only see the floor (Oh no no)
So let's face forward, and look up at the sky (Yay yay yay)

With our tension high (Hey!) let's be positive (Hey!)
There's no point in worrying
Let's go searching for fun things together!

Go forward! We're going and going and raring to go!
Our hearts are pounding and sounding it out
Here and now in this place, it's ok to leave them be
All your difficult worries
Let's climb over everything with everything we've got
Even though we sometimes get insecure
If you don't challenge yourself, nothing will ever start
When we fall over, it's 'cause we're pitching forward
Heading far ahead, heading far ahead

How much have you cried already? But please, no more
Don't cry!

As long as your sensor for thrilling things is working, you'll be in the right (It's alright!)
It's fine to just walk with your instincts as your guideposts (No doubt about it!)

Sure there'll be days when you're negative
Your mood's down or you're defeated
Things are always easier said than done

But still, keep moving now, moving now, words like "we can't"
Being told that actually gets me more pumped
I'll change the 'impossible' to something that's 'possible'
Even if they laugh at me
After all, beyond the unknown path is a future that's shining with light
If you stretch out your hand, someday you'll grasp hold of it
C'mon, put your hands up, high up in the sky

When you feel lost, try using a loud voice!
everybody say
Going Going
Moving Moving
Going Going
Moving Moving

Go forward! We're going and going and raring to go!
Our hearts are pounding and sounding it out
Here and now in this place, it's ok to leave them be
All your difficult worries
Let's climb over everything with everything we've got
Even though we sometimes get insecure
If you don't challenge yourself, nothing will ever start
Have a never give up spirit!

So let's keep moving now, moving now, words like "we can't"
Being told that actually gets me more pumped
I'll change the 'impossible' to something that's 'possible'
Even if they laugh at me
After all, beyond the unknown path is a future that's shining with light
If you stretch out your hand, someday you'll grasp hold of it
C'mon, put your hands up, high up in the sky
Higher than anyone, high up in the sky
