If...
We never met, if I had never known you all--
I can't even imagine it now

While fostering the fragments of all your dreams
I found myself, at some point, growing just as passionate
So that everyone's hopes will never dim
I want to protect them, I want to keep on protecting them

I'm sure
We were destined to meet, even if our ways will eventually part
The promise of today's brightness overflowed

And then my dream gave everyone wings
Surrounded by everyone's smiling faces
I never want those precious feelings to fade
I want to embrace them, I want to hold them dear

Even if at times crushing sorrow fills my heart
I'll keep watching over you, always, always

While fostering the fragments of all your dreams
I found myself, at some point, growing just as passionate
My dream gave everyone wings
Surrounded by everyone's smiling faces
I never want those precious feelings to fade
I want to embrace them, I want to hold them dear
