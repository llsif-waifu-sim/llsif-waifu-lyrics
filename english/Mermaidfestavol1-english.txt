No, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you

“I’m still dreaming an innocent dream”
When I whisper that into your ear
I close my eyes and sigh, It’s your fault
I dissolve into the sea bathing in the moonlight

Before diving into love
I won’t say anything…It’s-A-Se-cret
If I speak I’ll turn into foam, I’m a mermaid

The waves brought me here
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice
I dance with the waves so
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa

Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around
I’m getting hot from you

“Why aren’t you coming here? Are you aware?”
I’ll try teasing you a bit
Those painful excuses are so like you
The tension fills my heart with even more excitement

Symbols are written in the sand with bare feet
If you flip it around it reads I love you
What will you do when you notice? Will you be looking at me?

Next embrace me tightly
I’ll get away nimbly, Because now is the beginning of love
I want to be held tightly after that
You’re so gentle, What I want to know is you acting aggressively

Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I’ll pout over and over, I’ll pout even if we cuddle up
Spoil me


The waves brought me here
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice
I dance with the waves so
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa

Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around
Let it ring out, Let the summer love ring out

No, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you
