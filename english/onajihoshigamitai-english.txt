Don't leave...
With my fingertips, I want to convey that to you

Talking within dreams, deep within your mind,
While feeling a passion that cannot be extinguished
This me that's following you,
Just a little bit, I want you to notice me

I want to run through time together with you
Even if drenched with tears, I won't regret it

Don't leave...
With my fingertips, I want to convey that to you
For the sake of love, I'll flicker but burn on
I want to see the same stars


We're loved, but it's still lonely
Seeking each other's tenderness
There's a future waiting to be born for us
I believe in it, that's why I won't hesitate anymore

No matter what kind of tomorrow you're searching for
Your wounded heart, I want to embrace it

If we hug, it'll become warm
I love you... and our hearts will race
The two of us that falls into silence
Within us is the light of the crescent moon


Even if drenched with tears, I won't regret it

Don't leave...
With my fingertips, I want to convey that to you

If we hug, it'll become warm
I love you... and our hearts will race
For the sake of love, I'll flicker but burn on
I want to see the same stars; The two of us, in the same place

No matter when, these same stars are; No matter when, the stars of us two
