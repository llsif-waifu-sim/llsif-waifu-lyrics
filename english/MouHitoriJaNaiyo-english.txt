Please, don't anymore...
Shutting yourself away all alone
Will just make you sad, won't it?
I want you to call out to me

Please, don't anymore, okay?
You pretend you want to be alone
Because you don't want to be hurt, isn't that right?

"Please remember me," I murmured
As the stars shined brightly through the night

There'll be times you want to cry; We can be together then
You may not be able to find any words, but as long as we're together, isn't that fine?

Yes, I know what you mean...
Whenever you bottle up your feelings,
You end up torn up on the inside, don't you?
Why not try talking about how you feel?

Yes, you understand, don't you?
If my heart had wings,
I'd want to send to you an "I love you"

So remember me, okay?
With a sigh, the stars fell throughout the night

There'll be times you want to cry; We can be together then
You may not be able to find any words, but as long as we're together, isn't that fine?
Whenever you want to see me, we can be together
You may not be able to find the right words, but as long as we're together, isn't that fine?

You don't have to be alone anymore
