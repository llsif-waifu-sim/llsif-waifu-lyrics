But... (Firmly...) Getting closer to "love"! (More!)
More.... (But...) Startled and rushing! (More! Firm!)

But... (Firmly...) A "pure" adventure! (More!)
More... (I knew it...) More of this pure love...! (More! Firm!)


More fidgety than usual, acting cuter than normal
How do we become lovey-dovey?
But... (Today...) Won’t come again

Can’t I believe the magic of love exists somewhere?
The miracle of love
Please... (For today) Awaken

(And so) A pure heart is justice! (It’s pure) You should turn around
(And so) How about gradually letting my sweet (Dreams) into your heart? Treat yourself (To my dreams)

Happy? Dear?
It’s the happiest love in the world
I’ll show you, I’ll show you, Somehow I’ll show you
With a lot of effort, I’ll do my best!
Happy? Dear? Touching?
I love you... (So much...) I love you...
(Catch me) Firmly (More) Look at me
Getting closer to “love”! Because I love you


Something’s different and I'm excited, I want to know who to ask
This is completely pure, pure love
I knew it... (How weird) I’m blushing

Let’s start the magic of love right now, the two of us!
I’m shy but I have courage
Good-bye to it... (How weird) How daring

(Listen) It’s a match through passion! (At length) Shall I talk to you?
(Listen) Let my acutely swelling and warm (Feelings) reach you! Accept (My feelings)

I want to give it! I want to figure it out!
Become the luckiest in the world
I saw it, I saw it, I saw the future
Really, will it turn out this way?
I want to give it! I want to figure it out! I want to be happy!
Stay…(Right here) Stay...
(Being flustered) I’m tired of that (So) Come with me
It’s a "pure" adventure! As I thought, it’s love

How weird... (As I thought) It’s a "pure" adventure! (But!)
How weird... (As I thought) It’s dizzyingly troubling! (Poof! Whoosh!)


I want to give it! I want to figure it out!
For the sake of today
With a "pure love", with "purity", we’re "lovingly" serious
I miss you!!

Happy? Dear?
It’s the happiest love in the world
I’ll show you, I’ll show you, Somehow I’ll show you
With a lot of effort, I’ll do my best!
Happy? Dear? Touching?
I like you... (So much...) I like you...
(Catch me) Firmly (More) Look at me
Getting closer to "love"! Because I love you

More (Firmly...) More firmly (More! Firm!)
Startled and rushing today!
