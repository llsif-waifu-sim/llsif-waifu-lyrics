That’s right, stretching far up high and without an end
Guiding the way to tomorrow
I want to shine with my very own light DIVE!

I didn’t have any confidence, I just
Locked up my heart and
Shut my ears to 
My own resounding voice

But actually, I’ve always 
Known that 
The most important thing 
Is right here, with me

The universe stretches out limitlessly
Without hesitating, I’ll advance
Go! Fly! Yes! So High!
I’ll close my eyes and
Try to listen
It’s already clamoring inside my body
My Heart won’t stop, it beats
Strongly! Passionately…!!

That’s right, stretching far up high and without an end
The future I embraced
Has become a path to take
These newborn feelings 
Will guide me to tomorrow
I want to shine with my very own light DIVE!

It’s not something that belongs to someone
Ask your heart and
On the path you’ve picked
Go forth, straightforwardly

No matter what
I won’t ever lose sight of it
Because I’ve found
The place most important to me

It doesn’t matter if you take a detour
Hold your head up high and we’ll advance
Louder! Sing! Louder!
I may be clumsy
But even if I get hurt it doesn’t matter
I want to live with these
Unclouded feelings Pride
True to myself…!!

I’ll spread out my arms, and
These ‘yesterdays’ that have been set free
Will become wings
These overlapping encounters
Will color this moment
I’ll believe in my very own light DIVE!

That’s right, stretching far up high and without an end
The future I embraced
Has become a path to take
These newborn feelings 
Will guide me to tomorrow
I want to shine with my very own light DIVE!
