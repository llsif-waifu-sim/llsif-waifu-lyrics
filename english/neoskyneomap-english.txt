On this road I'm jogging on,
Something's coming to life
That's what I want
To tell you about

Even the blueness of the sky
Changes along with the seasons
With nothing set in stone
It's inviting you to dream freely

There's no need to rush, let's go!
Let's enjoy this thrilling time even more!
More!
Let's all go after
The things that everyone loves

Though we still don't know where we're headed
The future that awaits us looks interesting
I would be happy if we could laugh together
Thank you for today
Now, these maps show what awaits each of us
When we open them up, let's fly out care-freely
While dreaming and having more ambitions
I want to see it, I want to see it!

I remembered the opportunity a little later
That everything is connected
The encounter is riddled with mystery
How long has it been decided?

The clouds flow and disappear
With tears flowing away
Did a new light arrive?
The story begins again

To a place you don't know, let's go!
I'll take care of you
Forever!
Because what I like is that
I can do my best

You still don't know when it will be
Are you waiting tomorrow for your wish to come true?
It's okay if you can talk to each other
Thank you for today
Now, let's map out our daily adventures
There is no one that is the same
The color of my dream is different, but my feelings are the same
So hot, together!

Today's blue sky is different from yesterday
Tomorrow's blue sky is different from today
In your eyes, in my eyes...
Ah, I can't say a word
If you're here at a time like this
I'm relieved
So
So, let's look up tomorrow
I'm here with you

Let's freely draw our "NEO MAP"
NEO MAP!

Though we still don't know where we're headed
The future that awaits us looks interesting
I would be happy if we could laugh together
Thank you for today
Now, these maps show what awaits each of us
When we open them up, let's fly out care-freely
While dreaming and having more ambitions
I want to see it, I want to see it!
NEO SKY, NEO MAP!
NEO SKY, NEO MAP!
