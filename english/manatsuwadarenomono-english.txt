Dancing in a red sun dress
Are you staring at me?
I want to avert my gaze but I can't avert it
Oh I want to be burned with passion

Tonight I want to know more than an exciting rhythm
I muttered words bolder than usual
Though they're my own feelings, I don't understand them at all (I don't want to)
These commands (from my heart)
Can't be controlled by reason (such a love)

A voice has arrived that I want to know
I think it's embarrassing
But I want to know more I want to know more
While realizing it's a dream I shouldn't have

Dancing in a red sun dress
Your eyes stare at me
I want to avert my gaze but I can't avert it
To whom does midsummer belong?

I want it to belong to you and me
In this season where our hearts don't stop
It seems like the door to my heart
Will open for the first time
You knock knock my heart

It's impossible that our faltering steps
Always turn feverish
I'm bewildered by these impulses

If I placed
My hand
On top of your hand
Will something begin?

Your profile is illuminated by fireworks
I had a hunch this day would surely come
I can't turn back anymore I don't want to return
I was lured by midsummer

I want to spend summer with you
After all, it's a season where our hearts don't stop
With an oppressively sweet scent
I suddenly felt like crying

Getting closer, separating
My head is getting numb from this dance
Come here, come here
I'm not afraid
Of anything anymore

Dancing in a red sun dress
Your eyes stare at me
I want to avert my gaze, but I can't avert it
To whom does midsummer belong?

I want it to belong to you and me
After all, it's a season where our hearts don't stop
It seems like the door to my heart will open for the first time
You knock knock on my heart!!

Ah, embrace me passionately!
