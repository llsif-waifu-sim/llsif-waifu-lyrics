Honest feelings tie everyone together
Even when we’re being serious we’re clumsy, Our hearts clash
But even so, I want to see. 
A big dream's right here. It’s only just begun

(I know)
It’s not just fun and games. We have to be tested
(I know)
Even though hardship lies in the future
(I’ll go)
When we come together we get stronger
(I’m sure) We’ll continue to change (We’ll be stars!)

If each of us can put our hearts into the things we love
A new (place) will be our goal
If we trust in the things each of us loves
We can (embrace) the excitement and move forward

(Leave your fears behind) With a brilliant smile
(Fly, fly high) We are in the present

Instead of just thinking about it, let’s all run together
Tomorrow is incomplete, We can’t predict it
It’ll just happen, A miracle is inevitable
This is just the start of everything

(I know)
For sure in times of sadness let’s look up
(I know)
The world will become more magnificent
(I want it)
I want to carry the radiance in my chest
(Firmly) So let’s compete together (We can fly!)

I feel that there’s no time to look back
I’ll spread (With you) Everywhere
I know there’s no time to look back
We’ll build anticipation for the stimulus

(Farewell to my weak self) Don’t put it out with a smile
(Fly, fly high) With us amidst the present

For our dreams to grow (We have to be tested)
The fire in my chest takes over (my temperature)
It’s so hot (it’s too hot) so it won’t stop
A risky bet? Let’s go win it!

If each of us put effort into the things we love
A new (place) will be our goal
If we trust in the things each of us loves
We can (embrace) the excitation and move forward

(Leave your fears behind) With a brilliant smile
(Fly, fly high) With us through the present
(Farewell to my weak self) Don’t put it out with a smile
(Fly, fly high) We are in the present

We've waited to shine
