Wonder zone
I was called to you and I came running
Without a doubt a mysterious dream is beginning

Hi! It’s beginning (Wonder feeling)
This special dream is so mysterious (Wonder feeling)

I want to give you some energy, tomorrow will be happy, too
There’s a ton to look forward to, I want to be excited

Even after energetically overdoing it and falling over
You should get back up quickly and smile!

No matter how painful things get
To shine you just have to give it your all without crying!

Wonder zone
A future where I can become strong
Let’s look for it together, I’m OK!
I was strongly called to you and I came running
Without a doubt an ambitious dream is beginning

Hi! It’s beginning (Wonder feeling)
This special dream is so mysterious (Wonder feeling)

Don't forget courage, if we push forward things will be Lucky
Everyone can see each other, be happy

In those anxious times when courage seems fleeting
Push yourself beyond your limits and look ahead!

I want to confirm it again and again
A sign to you for staying by my side!

Wonder sign
A future leading to warm joy
I want to feel it together, You’re my friend
I’ll get going warmly with you, Hurry up
Let’s firmly start an ambitious dream

Wonder zone
A future where I can become strong
Let’s look for it together, I’m OK!
I was strongly called to you and I came running
Without a doubt an ambitious dream is beginning

Hi! We’re starting it (Wonder feeling)
This grand dream’s so mysterious
(Wonder feeling)
