Hey, hey! Ah… we are Busters! 

Trouble is piling up into a mountain, it can't be helped
(I really hate this, I’m so fed up with it)
I won’t lose, these things aren’t important (that’s right, that’s right)
I'll find a way without panicking, oh yeah!
(Trouble Busters! Pitter patter Busters!)

All right, that sort of person (Hey, you!)
All right, forget about him (Good-bye!)
It’s not a joke, from my sight (it’s not a joke)
Disappear forever! (you will disappear!)

With all your effort (Hey!) shall we laugh? (Hey!)
This much is nothing to me! (Ah, so!)
With all your effort (Hey!) shall we laugh? (Hey!)
It’s nothing, so smile!! (Niko!)
Hey now (Hey!) keep your chin up if you’re going to pretend (I love solitude)
It sprung out before I even realized, my Niko-Niko Smile (Niko!)

Hey, hey! Ah… we are Busters!

The disordered emotions within a sigh
(It’s really painful, I don’t want to talk about it)
I think my experience points have increased (That’s right, that’s right)
Don’t mind it and find my love, oh yeah!
(Trouble Busters! Irritated Busters!)

All right, from guys (Hey, you!)
All right, I want friendship please (Come on!)
I won’t believe your sweet words anymore (Sweet words are…)
I don’t ever need them, don’t ever need them! (Don’t need them)

Take my hand (Hey!) shall we run? (Hey!)
It isn't nothing, I can smile! (Ah, so!)
Take my hand (Hey!) shall we run? (Hey!)
It isn't nothing, smile today too!! (Niko!)
See you (Hey!) say goodbye to the memories (You are phantom)
The next wind will definitely blow on the Niko-Niko Stage (Niko!)

Laugh and forget and laugh and forget, tomorrow is going to be great ~smile
All right, all right! Good-bye, good-bye!
Laugh and forget and laugh and forget, tomorrow is going to be great ~smile
All right, all right! Good-bye, good-bye!
Because it's nothing, because it's not nothing, because it's everything and not nothing
That’s right, that’s right, laugh and forget, go ahead and laugh!

(Good-bye Baby) Therefore
(Good-bye Baby) I want to meet you
(Good-bye Baby) Next up is
(I won’t cry or anything) I will not lose
No more sadness, I don’t need it (Don’t need it!)

Take my hand, and shall we run? It isn't nothing, I can smile!
Take my hand, and shall we run? It isn't nothing, smile today too!!
With all your effort (Hey!) shall we laugh? (Hey!)
This much is nothing to me! (Ah, so!)
With all your effort (Hey!) shall we laugh? (Hey!)
It’s nothing, so smile!! (Niko!)
Hey now (Hey!) keep your chin up if you’re going to pretend (I love solitude)
It sprung out before I even realized, my Niko-Niko Smile
The next wind will definitely blow on the Niko-Niko Stage (Niko!)

Hey, hey! Ah… we are Busters!
