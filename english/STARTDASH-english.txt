I say...
Hey, hey, hey, START:DASH!!
Hey, hey, hey, START:DASH!!


Even newborn baby birds
Will someday soar through the sky 
They'll fly with great, strong wings

Don't ever give up
That day will definitely come
You can feel it too, can't you?
The beats of the beginning

O Tomorrow, change!
Transform into hope!
Transform, illuminated by that brilliant light
START!!

Being closed in by sorrow
And just crying -- That isn't you
With your blazing heart, you can definitely clear the way to the future
Being closed in by sorrow
And just crying is boring
I'm sure (I'm sure) your (dream's)
Power (right now) can set things in motion
I believe in you, so START!!

The mood after the rain
Amidst growing expectations
Even the times when we stumbled
Let them become memories

Tomorrow will blossom!
Hope will blossom!
A fun, hummed melody blossomed
DASH!!

Grasp the happiness and
Let's form a connection between us
We've finally broken through and found our way
Grasp the happiness and
You and I will push on forward
Those are (those are) a distant (dream's)
Fragments (but they're) precious fragments
Towards beyond the border... I'll DASH!!

And again, a dream is born


Being closed in by sorrow
And just crying -- That isn't you
With your blazing heart, you can definitely clear the way to the future

Grasp the happiness and
Let's form a connection between us
We've finally broken through and found our way
Grasp the happiness and
You and I will push on forward
Those are (those are) a distant (dream's)
Fragments (but they're) precious fragments
Towards beyond the border... I'll DASH!!


Hey, hey, hey, START:DASH!!
Hey, hey, hey, START:DASH!!
