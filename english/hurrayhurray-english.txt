Wow Wow… We'll reach it
Wow Wow… The future

At the start of the day, the classroom is illuminated like there's light filtering through the trees
There's a gleam (gleaming), the doodles on the desk smile up at us
You were the one who taught me this feeling of having always having someone by my side, 
Making me laugh, is truly irreplaceable 

Because of how dazzling every day is, I get a bit uneasy
(But even so) More than that, I'm so happy, I could cry

I want to convey this "Hurray, hurray"! 
Let's enjoy ourselves! All Right!!
We came here, supporting each other
You (Wow) and us
We've stumbled our way here so we'll believe 
In this unchanging future
Our friendship will always be there
Being this close to each other really is wonderful 
Let's go toward what awaits (Just like this)
Running straight ahead!
