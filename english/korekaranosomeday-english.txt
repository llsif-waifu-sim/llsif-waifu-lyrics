If we combine our feelings together
Perhaps we can manage somehow or another
Our power is tiny but
We have dreams that we want to nurture

There's so much we don't comprehend
There's nothing like road maps in our pockets
It'll be okay even if we just progress bit by bit
Let's stick our chests out proudly and push forward

What will you do when you mess up?
Why not try smiling? With a smile, shout "Yay, yay, yay!"
We'll be fine singing with genuine and honest voices
One, two, three, four
Everyone, over here!

Someday, our wishes will come true one day
Someday, let's have faith that they'll make it one day
There's no point in crying like that, after all
The fun has only just, only just begun!

The worries are never-ending
Even if we look back and sigh
We'll cheer each other on
I'm glad we're together again today

Teaching and being taught
It's so pleasant, our friendship increases
When we can't help but fight
We'll spring back and apologize

Nod impressively!
Try smiling! With a smile, shout "Hi, hi, hi!"
We'll be fine even though we make mistakes
One, two, three, four
As expected, over there!

Something, now there's something in your direction
Something, now there's something with a lovely feeling
That's what I feel like telling you, so just wait a bit
There's much more, much more fun to come!

What will you do when you mess up?
Why not try smiling? With a smile, shout "Yay, yay, yay!"
We'll be fine singing with genuine and honest voices
One, two, three, four
Everyone, over here!

Someday, our wishes will come true one day
Someday, let's have faith that they'll make it one day
There's no point in crying like that, after all
The fun has only just, only just begun!
