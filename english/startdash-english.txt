I say...
Hey, hey, hey, START:DASH!!
Hey, hey, hey, START:DASH!!


Even baby birds swaddled in down
Will someday flap their wings and take to the sky
They'll soar up high with wings that grow big and strong

We won’t ever think of giving up—
Such a grand day will come for us.
Surely you feel it as strong as us.
The initial beat of our wings...

Change for tomorrow!
Change for that higher hope!
Let’s try and change for the better, bathed in a dazzling bright light!
START!!

If you’re imprisoned by a deep sadness,
crying will be the least of your worries.
Allow your burning heart, open a pathway to the future
If you’re imprisoned by a deep sadness,
you will find no joy if you simply cry
Surely (We’re sure) all our dreams (all your dreams)
have the power (right this moment) the bring about change
We believe in you, so let’s START!!

It’s like how you feel after a rainfall
You can feel your anticipation grow
And even if you stumble or fail...
Treasure the memory!

It helps tomorrow bloom
It helps make our hopes blossom
Let’s hum the lively melody that these feelings made bloom,
DASH!!

All you need is to accept our delight,
and then follow our lead and sing along.
We can finally make our way out of that emotional prison.
All you need is to accept our delight,
Follow our lead and you’re sure to advance.
It can feel (and it is) so distant (as our dream)
and maybe it’s (merely) a fragment, but we love it.
That’s why, to the future... we will DASH!!

Yet another dream has been born on this day!

If you’re imprisoned by a deep sadness,
crying will be the least of your worries.
Allow your burning heart, open a pathway to the future

All you need is to accept our delight,
and then follow our lead and sing along.
We can finally make our way out of that emotional prison.
All you need is to accept our delight,
Follow our lead and you’re sure to advance.
It can feel (and it is) so distant (as our dream)
and maybe it’s (merely) a fragment, but we love it.
That’s why, to the future... we will DASH!!


Hey, hey, hey, START:DASH!!
