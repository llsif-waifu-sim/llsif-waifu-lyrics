It’s a mystery, but nevertheless a coincidence
That in this place, we met at the stream of fate
It’s a mystery, it finally changes
I want to see the course of the passing time up until the very end

I can’t ask “for whose sake do I embark on this journey?”
Surely (surely) within your eyes (within your eyes)
Ah! Do you hold the answer?
“For whose sake do I embark on this journey?” I’ll smile
I can’t ask that. Do you understand?

It’s important, right? However, all of a sudden
We are talking about the love born from the heart
It’s important, right? Tell me softly
About this ritual to confirm our love

I can’t say “I will be filled with happiness forever”
Always (always) day after day (day after day)
Ah! It should pile up, right?
“I will be filled with happiness forever” I’ll smile
I can’t say that even if I wish for it

While having fun, and while watching over you (it was exhilarating)
Finally that day comes, it is each and every tomorrow

I can’t ask “for whose sake do I embark on this journey?”
Surely (surely) within your eyes (within your eyes)
Ah! Do you hold the answer?
“For whose sake do I embark on this journey?” I’ll smile
I can’t ask that. Do you understand?
There’s no way I can say farewell
