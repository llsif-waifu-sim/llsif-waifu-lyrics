In your eyes burns a blue flame; Putting on a strong front, you the LONELIEST BABY
So, comin' comin' back!
Just staying sulky there doesn't work, you know?
Look over here... Please!

Somehow painful one day, shaking with loneliness one day
Oh yeah, oh yeah! Teach me my boy
Aiming for the waiting night sky
Call me, call me!! The signal you're skipping is "L.O.V.E"

Because I want to hug you with these feelings of love
I'm gazing at only you right here

Always I love you I love you (I want to tell you) I love you I love you
No matter when　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Without losing
I'm praying　Ah...!(Let's fight!)
I love you I love you (Love you love you) I love you I love you
Don't forget during the times when you're tired, just a little bit
Recall and think about me　Baby!

The oath your seriousness conceived, don't tell it to anyone
So, goin' goin' now!
If you're too quiet there'll be misunderstandings, you know?
Say something... Please!

Crying in the rain one day, getting drenched and sad one day
Oh yeah, oh yeah! I want to meet you my boy
I've been waiting, my heart is calling out
Call me, call me!! The signal right now is "L.O.V.E"

Once you're in love, everything can be forgiven
Really... Because I am someone that belongs only to you

Always I love you I love you (Unchanging) I love you I love you
Sometimes　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Also weak
What's dear to me　Ah...!(I know!)
I love you I love you (Love you love you) I love you I love you
Because you're dear to me, when you want to take a break, I want to protect you gently
I wanna hold you, Baby!

Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!) Why, I wonder?
Even when you're strong and even when you're weak
Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!) I love you!
I love all of it, the lonely my boy
Your oath, your heart; you are you are, lonely boy
The passionate you, where is it you're aiming for?

Always I love you I love you (Unchanging) I love you I love you
Sometimes　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Also weak
What's dear to me　Ah...!(I know!)
Always I love you I love you (I want to tell you) I love you I love you
No matter when　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Without losing
I'm praying　Ah...!(Let's fight!)
I love you I love you (Love you love you) I love you I love you
Don't forget during the times when you're tired, just a little bit
Recall and think about me　Baby!

Oh baby I love you, oh baby I love you!
You are you are, Lonely boy
Oh baby I love you, oh baby I love you!
Oh baby I love you!!
