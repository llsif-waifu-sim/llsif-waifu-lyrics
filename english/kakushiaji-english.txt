Tonight's menu is cream stew (crew stew ×2)
But can we make it taste good?
We may have 150 ml of milk (milk ×2)
But I don't care about such details
I want us to think outside the box

For example,
Should we add some tabasco?
No, that not a good idea!
What about star-shaped carrots?
That's doesn't sound half bad!
Soon, our dish will be complete!

Does our masterpiece taste good?
We put a lot of love into it for everyone
It tastes good? That means we did it!
Your smile is the best seasoning we could have asked for
This taste just like magic!
I'll cherish this everyday life

It's almost ready (it smells good ×2)
Which plate do you think is the cutest?
Make it photogenic (photo ×2)
I'm serving it up, so don't mess it up!
This is a work of art!

I'm going to steal some salad when no one's looking♡
Hey, I really do not like green peppers!
Bring the food to the table
Get your fork and spoon
And the rest is up to you
Thank you for the food! Now, everyone...

Our masterpiece has been served!
After all, this homemade dish was made with
Love! A lot of love!
Our cooking is more extravagant compared to restaurant's food
Our lack of experience is hidden in the flavor
But that's what makes it great, doesn't it?

"Mmm! This is delicious!"
"I'm getting seconds!"
"Huh, aren't you eating a tad too quickly!?"

Tonight, we're having a party at home
Dancing to rock n' roll music, Oh yeah!

There's an endless supply of recipes and choices
And original flavors too
This combination is a miracle
Just like you and me
I love when we're all
Just laughing the night away

Thanks for the meal, I've been deeply satisfied
Everyone is filled with so much love
We did it! This is a win!
Your smile is the best seasoning we could have asked for
This taste just like magic!
I'll cherish this everyday life
