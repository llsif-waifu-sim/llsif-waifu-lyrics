Even on a never-ending road, I walk one step at a time
As long as I don't give up, my dream can't run away from me.
It's because you are right beside me
That I can overcome adversity and sadness.
Thank you

I'd miss a step and fall, I'd look at the map and still be lost
Sometimes I cannot move forward at all. Life is so hard.

When I whine that I can't walk anymore
You were there to hold my hand, right?

Away from the unchanging days, I walk step by step
Advancing to the future with courage in me.
The sparkling shining dazzling everyday
That you gave to me
Is a wonderful, beautiful present.

It's more fun to dream together than alone
We share our pains, so our joys will be infinite

We're no longer just friends, or even best friends
We're partners in polishing ourselves

Even on a never-ending road, I walk one step at a time
As long as I don't give up, my dream can't run away from me
It's because you are right beside me
That I can overcome adversity and sadness
Thank you

You have supported me and fostered me all this time
From now on, so that I can be the one to support you
I have to get stronger and stronger
Next time, I want to protect you

Away from the unchanging days, I walk step by step
Advancing to the future with courage in me
The sparkling, shining, dazzling everyday
That you gave to me
Is a wonderful, beautiful present

Because you're here, I can shine too
Thank you
