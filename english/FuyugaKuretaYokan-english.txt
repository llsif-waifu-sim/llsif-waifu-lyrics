Footsteps approach, and I wish that they were yours
Even though I know that can't be right
Those feelings, of wanting to walk close by your side--
I find myself wishing for you to accept them

My unformed words leave my mouth as a chilly sigh
And disappear in an instant, at the street corner where I stand alone
I'm searching for your back among the crowd
Even though I know you can't possibly be there

I should've told you today that I wanted to see you
Now I regret missing that chance
If only I had it in me to pull out my phone, and call you to say
"Come here, come quick, please..."

Hesitating, indecisive, I still can't make up my mind
Even as I count the stars with my fingertips
The day I fell in love -- thinking about it makes my chest hurt
Hesitating, indecisive, I still can't make up my mind
The night's about to end, I have to make my choice soon, but...
Falling in love has made me a bit of a coward, huh?

Footsteps approach, and I wish that they were yours
Even though I know that can't be right
Those feelings, of wanting to walk close by your side--
I find myself wishing for you to accept them

When I stopped to pick up the decorative lights that had fallen from the window
I suddenly felt like crying
I got the vague sense that I'd be seeing you today
But I want to believe it's more than just a gut feeling

I wish I'd told you outright that I wanted to see you
But I stubbornly bit my tongue for no real reason
I think I'll try going to our usual place
Just in case you'll be there...

Hesitating, indecisive, I still can't make up my mind
The night's about to end, I have to make my choice soon, but...
Falling in love has made me a bit of a coward, huh?

Once I've started running, even while trembling from the cold
My cheeks and heartbeat began growing hot
The day I fell in love -- thinking about it makes tears fill my eyes
Once I've started running, even while trembling from the cold
I can see someone waving at me from the distance
I'm sure it must be you, rushing towards me...

Footsteps approach -- your footsteps
Are heading straight towards me
Those feelings, of wanting to walk close by your side--
With those same feelings, you run towards me

(The premonition winter gave me, that you'll definitely come) 
(That premonition of winter, passion calling for love)
