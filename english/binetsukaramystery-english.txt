This year's summer has a different scent than usual
This year's summer is hiding an intoxicating scent

I wish I could be a little more mature right now
I've felt this way ever since I first heard your voice
So turn around...

What will be my next dream?
A premonition of unknown sorrow
It's scary, but I don't want to run away... this fever is a mystery
What is this sudden new dream?
A premonition of unknown excitement
I want to learn more from you (Is it a coincidence? Or...)
I can't do anything by myself!

Swaying in this year's summer, I thought of changing my hairstyle
Swaying in this year's summer, I blush as I wear my swimsuit

I'm always watching you passionately, though it's embarrassing
Why won't you notice my gaze?
Hurry and turn around...

Under the scorching rays of the sun
I really am too shy
But your kindness hurts... my first love is a mystery
Under the sweet rays of the sun
I'm too shy to speak
I have a request for you (I want my heart to beat faster)
Please fall in love with me!

Hurry and turn around... (Face me)
This love is overflowing

What will be my next dream?
A premonition of unknown sorrow
It's scary, but I don't want to run away... this fever is a mystery
What is this sudden new dream?
A premonition of unknown excitement
I want to learn more from you (Is it a coincidence? Or...)
I can't do anything by myself!
