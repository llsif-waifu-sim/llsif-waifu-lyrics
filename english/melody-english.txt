I found the things 
I like right here
Full of energy, always giving it my all
Because that's how the real me does it

I want you to be on my side more than anyone else
I hope I can reach the deepest part of your heart
Believe in me today as well — let's sing!

The feeling I ran through dyed my heart a bright red
And tears flew out of my eyes
This path is uncertain but I'll do it 'cuz I like it
At this rate I feel like I'll start to shine

As the reflector points on me
I'll always be on this stage
Shining as bright as I can
With a song full of strong wishes, 
I'll reach for that blue sky — yes, I will reach it! 

The future
For a lot of people is a whole unknown world
I'm really anxious, but I know this is important
Because those are my real feelings

I want to have the courage to someday seize it with my hands
Let's try to hit the problems with some real words
Connecting our hearts — let's sing!

Throwing my strongest smile my cheeks turned into the brightest red
And the pain flew out from my heart
Even the hardest moments will someday turn around
And I feel like I can be stronger that what I ever thought before

If we encounter the things we like
Grab on and hold them tight them like nothing else
Hoping they'll never leave
With a song full of strong wishes, 
I'll reach for that blue sky — yes, I will reach it! 

"Why is it you don't have any recollection of me?"
As soon as I said these words it dawned on me

The feelings I've always yearned for were always in this place where I left them
I found them playing in the sky
I am no longer afraid to express my true self
I feel like I can finally say what I want

As the reflector points on me
I'll always be on this stage
Shining as bright as I can
With a song full of strong wishes, 
I'll reach for that blue sky — yes, I will reach it!
