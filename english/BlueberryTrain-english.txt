It's beginning to run, the Berry Berry Train
Sweet and sour

Mr. Mirror, please teach me
Make me as cute as you can!

All girls worry about this 
For now, fashion is max priority!

Leave it on? Take it off? I turn around 
Does the ribbon look good on my hair?

Yan yan, I'm going to be late!
Oh no, dash to the station!
Will I start my first date off with an apology?
Yan yan, that would be bad!
Oh no, train, please hurry!
This uneasy feeling is sour, Blueberry Train

Mr. Clock, please listen to me
Please stop ticking, just for a little bit

It's an excuse all girls give
It's inevitable for the sake of looking pretty

Open it? Or maybe not? Repeating that in my head
Fiddling with the button on my chest

Really, I thought about it a lot
There's no time to reconsider!
It would be the worst to keep my promised date waiting!
Really, I'm hesitating too much
Is it too late to reconsider?
I'm hoping that you'll be a little late, Blueberry Train

Yan yan, I'm going to be late!
Oh no, dash to the station!
Will I start my first date off with an apology?
Yan yan, that would be bad!
Oh no, train, please hurry!
This uneasy feeling is sour, Blueberry Train

Really, I thought about it a lot
There's no time to reconsider!
It would be the worst to keep my promised date waiting!
Really, I'm hesitating too much
Is it too late to reconsider?
I'm hoping that you'll be a little late, Blueberry Train
