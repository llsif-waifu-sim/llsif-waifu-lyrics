I feel as though our encounter has changed me
I found the person I want to become
I've been always, always raising up
This longing, only in my heart

Along the great big rope, everybody jumped, playing together
But I alone was too scared to join
Hesitating like a child
I was always waiting for you

When I was about to give up, your hand reached out to support me
The warmth of your gentle hand-- I love it

My gratitude is about to overflow
Little by little, my dream draws closer
My gratitude is about to overflow...
Thank you
I'm happy, so happy that I don't know what to do
So happy that my tears come spilling out
I'm sorry

Rather than hanging my head, unable to form words
I'll say goodbye to these feelings of hesitation
I've always, always longed to see you
I can't let it end only in my heart

Over and over, everyone jumped along the jump rope
And I smiled and laughed, too
Let's always be together and play
That feeling is precious to me

When I lost my way, your eyes led me
Those gentle eyes made my wish come true

This throbbing in my heart won't disappear with a 'thank you'
Little by little, I'm grabbing hold of my dream
This throbbing in my heart won't disappear with a 'thank you'
Thank you
Isn't it fun? Isn't it fun? When I try to embrace you
My tears come spilling out
I'm sorry

My gratitude is about to overflow
Little by little, my dream draws closer
My gratitude is about to overflow...
Thank you
I'm happy, so happy that I don't know what to do
So happy that my tears come spilling out
I'm sorry
