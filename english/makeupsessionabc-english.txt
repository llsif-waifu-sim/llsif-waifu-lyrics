Put a little pink blush on your cheeks, you've gotta look good for the cameras
Look up just a little, put on an embarrassed face and... Snap! How cute♪

Because I want to sparkle (and shine) I've done a lot of studying (and research!) Cause that's just what girls do (what all girls do)
It's frustrating, I know, but do you think I could take a peek into your makeup case?

Holding the Make-up session Hey, won't you teach me those secret ABCs? The very art of being cute
It's like you've cast a spell on the mirror; I'm sure people will be smitten!

The change I'm seeing happen on this screen, I can't take my eyes off of it (We're changing!) Let me show you too!

Put some natural-colored rouge on your lips, it looks really great on you
In a carefree fashion, strike a relaxed pose and... Snap! Isn't that cute!
 
Because I want my heart to pound (and race) more and more! I've set out on a quest (to pursue it) because that's just what idols do (isn't it?)
How do I look? I want to match (with you)
 
Holding the Make-up meeting Hey, can we have a charming little chat about those secret ABCs? Things we could only talk about here
Who's the most good-looking person here? It must surely be me!

I've got to make my hair all fluffy (and soft), but I'll admit it's a bit (just a little) tough (even for me)
But I have to be cute! (such is) my destiny as a maiden
