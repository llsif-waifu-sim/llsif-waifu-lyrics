Before we knew it
We've come so far
Ah, the sky is as blue as ever

Our desire to obtain something
When we had nothing
Ah, is that what paved the way for us?

I learned that a miracle would happen
I wish I could tell that to ourselves back then

That not giving up is the key to your dreams
Is it okay if I say it now? I want to say it

Our hearts shake in hesitation, yet face ahead
No rain lasts forever, We ran all the way here
If we just look up, there will be the warm sun

From one person to two,
And from two to everyone, it was handed down
Ah, the beat of our dreams

Even though we had nothing
We felt like we could achieve something
Ah, maybe it was too daring, but we persisted

A miracle happened (A miracle) it really did
I want to tell that to our worried selves

In times when we want to throw it all away, and times we have to make big changes
Surely the chances will be there, They were there
You can't search for a miracle without moving, Even if you take a break never stop
Knowing every night will dawn, we ran all the way here
There will always be the warm sun

If we sing about our future, our courage, our light
Even if our words are awkward, they'll reach
So, let's use a loud voice!

Not giving up is the key to your dreams
Is it okay if I say it now? I want to say it

Our hearts shake in hesitation, yet face ahead
No rain lasts forever, We ran all the way here
If we just look up, there will be the warm sun

You can't search for a miracle without moving, Even if you take a break never stop
In the dawning night sky...is the warm sun!
