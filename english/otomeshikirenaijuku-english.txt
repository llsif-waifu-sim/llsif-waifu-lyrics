You can't be playing such mean pranks
Come on, stop that! (Straighten up!)
Shove those jokes into your pocket! (Think about it seriously)
I'll teasingly scold you with a super scary face
Come on already! (Straighten up!)
You're best when you're serious, after all
So let's kiss! (Was that too mean?) Just kidding!

(Hey hey!)

Don't turn away (I want you to keep looking at me)
Hold me tight; I want to live out my youth...

I won't know that you think I'm cute unless you say so!
This love is too lonely
I'll dote on you more, okay? (Okay? Okay? Okay?)
That's just what girls do!

You can't be playing such mean pranks
Come on, stop that! (Straighten up!)
Shove those jokes into your pocket! (Think about it seriously)
I'll teasingly scold you with a super scary face
Come on already! (Straighten up!)
You're best when you're serious, after all
So let's kiss! (Was that too mean?) Just kidding!

(Hey hey!)

We're getting closer and closer (My ears feel hot)
I don't want you to go anywhere, but the words just won't come out...

I'm waiting for your confession of love, but aah, you're so slow!
Painful love is prohibited
Today's your chance (Yes, yes, yes)
Tomorrow I'll be a true maiden!

I'm indecisive about the things I really hate
I don't know what to do! (Straighten up!)
I have to pay attention to what truly matters (Impatiently)
My words are becoming meaner than they should
I don't know what to do! (Straighten up!)
I want you to stay serious
So why are you doing this? (I'm disappointed!) It's too bad...!

Learn the way of a maiden!

You can't be playing such mean pranks
Come on, stop that! (Straighten up!)
Shove those jokes into your pocket! (Think about it seriously)
I'll teasingly scold you with a super scary face
Come on already! (Straighten up!)
You're best when you're serious, after all
So let's kiss! (Was that too mean?) Just kidding!

(Hey hey!)
