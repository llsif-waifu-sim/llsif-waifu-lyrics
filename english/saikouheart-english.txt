When the sun rises, and the light overflows
Let's start running together!

Ohhhhh! HIGH FIVE!!
Hello! (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Hello! (Hey! Say!)
Look, this sparkling day is about to begin!

The sunlight sways in a sky so blue
Take a deep breath in the clear sky
Hey, let's find all kinds of fun stuff
To start the day off right!
(Let's go! Here we go!)
Even sleeping (na na..)
Is such a waste of time! (Like seriously)
Feeling excited or impatient (Ai! Ai!)
Is like an unstoppable night and day
(Because of your heart)

That smile is the source of my power (and I love it)
On any day, I'll be shining bright 24-7

The sun shines down on us, c'mon let's go!
This love shines as bright as the sun
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
I want to see your sincere smile
Because laughter is amazing!
Our hearts illuminate the place
(Woh Woh, Woh Woh)
I want to become the sun

These dancing beats dance with you
I'm so obsessed with this moment in particular
Hey, are you ready
To become even hotter?
(Let's go! Here we go!)
If things happen so quickly, (na na..)
It's such a waste of time! (Like seriously)
Feeling excited or nervous (Ai! Ai!)
Can't stop this giant wave
(Because of your heart)

That smile will become a treasure (and I love it)
It feels great being able to laugh with you all the time...

The sun will shine down on us, c'mon let's go!
This love shines as bright as the sun
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
I want to show you this unforgettable dream
Sharing is caring!
Our hearts are burning up
(Woh Woh, Woh Woh)
I want to become the sun

Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
(cla, cla, cla, Clap!)
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
(cla, cla, cla, Clap!)
More and more, and even more!
(cla, cla, cla, Clap!)
This is so amazing!

Let's sing and dance the night away
Let's keep the same memories in our hearts

The sun is going to be dyed
Ah, now it's just one feeling
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
I want to see your sincere smile
Because laughter is amazing!
Thank you for inspiring me
(Woh Woh, Woh Woh)
I hope to see you here again

Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
(cla, cla, cla, Clap!)
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
(cla, cla, cla, Clap!)
More and more, and even more!
(cla, cla, cla, Clap!)
This is so amazing!
Ahhhhh Gimme Five!!
