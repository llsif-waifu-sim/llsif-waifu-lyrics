Is this your first time coming here?
I will explain things brief and nicely
But before that I will have 
to ask for your name!

In a story all about sleeping
Don't leave your dreams as just dreams
That's the kind of place 
We've come to make here

The things that you're not able to say
The things you think can't be helped
Everything like that you should forget it, don't hesitate

Welcome to the world of dreams!
There's just one rule for this fairy tale
Forgive the selfishness of 
The Princess just this time
Riding along this melody
I will make sure all of you are happy
Together with those feelings
I will always be here 

Is it somewhat clearer for you now?
Look forward and there you'll see the stage
All our wishes are also
Included with it!

We will need more than just prayers
Made on shooting stars
Everybody gets together
Wanting to make them real

In this world so far and wide
No one else has ever heard this fairy tale
Again with the Princess' selfishness
Shall we just roll along with it?
Riding along a fluffy rhythm
Where do you think this parade has an end?
I'd rather be always be 
Wrapped in this shining happiness

Everybody, welcome to the world of dreams
Today's Kanata-chan is that selfish Princess
If this moment when everybody is smiling lasted forever
That would be fine for me

Even when the day you call today is over
This fairy tale will never disappear
I always will protect
With this song this glittering scenery

Welcome to the world of dreams!
There's just one rule for this fairy tale
Forgive the selfishness of 
The Princess just this time
Riding along this melody
I will make sure all of you are happy
Together with those feelings
I will always be here
