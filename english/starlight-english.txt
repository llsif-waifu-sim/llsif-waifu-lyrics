I gotta see the Starlight
You gotta see the Starlight

Let this body heat, alright??
Even if you wake up from a dream
A world that remembers

I will let you stay beside me
I cannot feel, nor think anything
No.1 in absolute charm

Fly Fly to this stage
Come on, the lighting Starlight
(Tonight veiled by Neon)
The spotlight that colors up to the maximum
(Oh, shout)

This isn't enough, raise the volume
The high resonance is addictive
Raise it as I yearn for it
Fly! Fly! Call me
The Starlight dancing in time

Lured by a sweet voice, is a taste of a maze, alright?
I've chosen this myself, I cannot turn back

I will let someone else be the captive
I cannot feel, nor think anything
No.1 in pleasing feeling

Fly high to that image
Yes! Enchant the Starlight
(Just the guided tonight)
The boldly-colored Spotlight (Oh, feel it)

I will let you stay besides me
I feel nothing I can not think
No.1 in absolute charm

Fly Fly to this stage Come on Come on Starlight
(Tonight veiled by Neon)
The spotlight that colors up to the maximum
(Oh, shout)

This isn't enough, raise the volume
The high resonance is addictive
Raise it as I yearn for it
Fly! Fly! Call me! The Starlight dancing in time

The starlight dancing in time
Fly! Fly! Call me! The Starlight dancing in time
