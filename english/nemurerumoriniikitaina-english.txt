After I finish my homework
All I wanna do is jump straight onto 
My fluffy, fluffy bed
And laze around

The sleeping beauty from the forest… ah, how I aspire to be you
After all, y'see, you'd get to sleep all the time, right?
I'd be so happy!

Good morning~ everyone.
Though I’m probably dreaming right now…
No matter what, I'm always doing my best!
So, naturally, I'm always sleeping my best, too…?
All around the clock…

Now, it’s finally come…
The moment we’ve all been waiting for!
I hug my fluffy, furry pillow
And I drift off

The sleeping beauty from the forest… I'm so jealous of her!
I wonder what kinds of dreams she has?
It makes me fantasize!

Good morning~ everyone.
Huh? Is this reality…?
Whether it's cooking or studying, I'm always doing my best!
So, naturally, I'm always sleeping my best, too…?
Morning, noon, and night…

Ah, is it this time already…?
I guess just I'll sleep a bit more…

"Good niiight…"
