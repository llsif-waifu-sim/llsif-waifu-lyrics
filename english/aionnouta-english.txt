If you want to cry the tears you held back
It'd be okay to cry so many you could drown in them
If someday, this day comes back to mind
It'd be nice if you could be kind to someone

This shining love from over a thousand years
Is embedded with a thousand mile's worth of feelings

That's why, whenever you feel dreary, 
I'll play this song and envelop you in it
So that this warmth will reach you, I'll sing to you
Closer to your side than anyone else

On the moonlit nights you spend alone
You can come here, just as you asked

The miracle of finding a cast-off cicada shell, empty of anything,
Is tightly connected to embraces, full of compassion

That's why, like the bright, cheerful sun,
I'll show you a dream
So that I can give this warmth to you
I'll sing to that heart of yours

If by any chance, your heart feels
Healed by this song
Then, similarly, I hope that you can
Someday guide somebody else through their pain

Whenever you feel dreary, 
I'll play this song and envelop you in it
So that this warmth will reach you
I'll stay closer to your side than anyone else, ah...

Like the bright, cheerful sun,
I'll show you a dream
So that I can give this warmth to you
I'll sing to that heart of yours
