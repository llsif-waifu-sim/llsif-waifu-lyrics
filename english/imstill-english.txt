Silhouettes of gray above the road I walk today
When was the last time I saw the reflection of my face?
It's easy just to say that everything will be okay
But is that the answer that's really deep inside my heart?

It's not always going to be a sunny day, I know
But if I try I might just get a glimpse

I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
Go through the clouds
Fly free towards the sky
The scenery my heart pictured, the road only for me
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming
