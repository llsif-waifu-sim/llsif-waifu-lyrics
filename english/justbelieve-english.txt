We've opened up a blank white page
We'll paint it with colorful feelings
The little pieces of our dream
Have carried us
To where we met

Get going! There we go!
Even in heavy rain,
If we shine brightly
The road will rise vividly before us
C'mon, let's keep going!

Go beyond the light! Accelerate to full throttle
Our vision is clear as can be
Just Believe!!! Just Believe!!!
It's no longer a single person's dream
So there are no limits we can't reach, and after that
Ah, the scenery we wanted to see spreads before us
Hey, let's try to make any miracles we want come true
Riding on the wind, 3, 2, 1 we go!

On your mark... let's jump into the world!
Snap your fingers to the rhythm in your heart
Give your footsteps more energy
And you'll look back on it with a smile

We got it! Here we go!
The tone of our passion
Is big and strong, ringing out
Ah, nothing but courage is welling up

Light before my eyes, engines at full power
It's going better than I expected
Just believe!!! Just believe!!!
Catch  that jet stream
That's right, we can fly anywhere
Beyond the blue waters
Ah, there's a sight I gotta show you
Hey, let's try to make any miracles we want come true
Riding on the wind, 3, 2, 1 we go!

Somewhere, the evening sun sets
But rises again somewhere else

Go beyond the light! Accelerate to full throttle
Our vision is clear as can be
Just Believe!!! Just Believe!!!
It's no longer a single person's dream
So there are no limits we can't reach, and after that
Ah, the scenery we wanted to see spreads before us
Hey, let's try to make any miracles we want come true
Riding on the wind, 3, 2, 1 we go!
