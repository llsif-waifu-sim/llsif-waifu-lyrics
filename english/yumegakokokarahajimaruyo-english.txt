La la la...
Reach out your hands
La la la...
And chase after your dreams

The album  of our heart is overflowing with memories
Even the tears we shed will start to shine now
We spread out our plans for the future together
And we want to keep envisioning it freely
If we've encountered something that we love
Let's run towards it without hesitation 

The new stories are about to begin
The courage that sprouted that day
Has transcended time and is now blossoming even bigger
May your feelings resonate and reach faraway
Your dreams are opening up a new page
Let's step onto the new stage
Don't worry, it'll be okay
I know better than anyone else that our wish will come true
Let's head to a brand new tomorrow
Our dreams begin here

La la la ...
Reach out our hands
La la la ...
To catch your dream

"If I was alone ..."
"If I'm not with you ..."
It's because of everyone
That today was able to shine

Run down every single road
Towards the figure that makes your heart race
From my heart to yours
Our dreams will spread

Let's sing about our new stories
The courage I received that day
Will last for eternity
I want to give it to you as well
I'll send these passionate feelings more than ever before
Yell! To get that dream to that one person
Let's step onto the new stage
At any time, it'll be okay, so don't give up
Since it's a new dawn
Our dreams will be connected here

Once we securely tie the ribbon at our chest
So that it won't come undone again
Let's go! (Let's go!)
Beyond that rainbow
Is a miracle waiting for us

Whenever I hear you
Calling my name
My heart starts beating faster;
I can become stronger
Let these passionate feelings reach you more and more
Thank you always and forever

The new stories are about to begin
The courage that sprouted that day
Has transcended time and is now blossoming even bigger
May your feelings resonate and reach faraway
Your dreams are opening up a new page
Let's step onto the new stage
Don't worry, it'll be okay
I know better than anyone else that our wish will come true
Let's head to a brand new tomorrow
Our dreams begin here

La la la...
Reach out your hands
La la la...
And chase after your dreams
