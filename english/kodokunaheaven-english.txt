My heart beats faster when I think about you
I'm burning up!

"You seem more tired than usual"
I quietly say from behind you

Can't you hear me?
My heart is speaking to you
Even though we're in the same classroom, you're too far away

Maybe I'm bothering you just by looking at you?
A sigh slips through my lips as I murmur to myself

This lonely heaven won't come to an end
I can't tell you to notice my feelings
Because I'm afraid of heartbreak
This love mustn't disappear
This is my lonely heaven
Painful yet affectionate
My heart beats faster when I think about you
I can't stop this burning passion!

After school, I spot you at the bus stop
You look like you're waiting for someone, but who?

Is she from our class? Or the class next door?
I want to know, but it hurts

What I want to say is really just a silly dream
I won't hope for anything more than this; my love can stay unrequited

I want to embrace my heaven
I won't seek anything more
I'll accept this heartache
Love is meant to be cried over, right?
Don't take away my heaven
Though it's small and fleeting
My heart beats faster when I think about you
I'm burning up; I want to hold you!

This lonely heaven won't come to an end
I can't tell you to notice my feelings
Because I'm afraid of heartbreak
This love mustn't disappear
This is my lonely heaven
Painful yet affectionate
My heart beats faster when I think about you
I can't stop this burning passion! This passionate heaven
