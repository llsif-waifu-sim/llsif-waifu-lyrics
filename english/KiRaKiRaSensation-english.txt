What kind of future awaits us? While wondering that
(I have been) We all have been slowly fumbling along our way

Encouraging one another, and even when we clashed
(We knew) We shared the same dream

What we aim for is that sun
To capture that great brilliance
We're getting closer to fulfilling our wishes
Let's sing our Sensations within the light!

The miracle is right here and now
Everyone's feelings led them to this place
That's why, we'll enjoy this moment
The story that we will bring to life together, the Story of our dreams
"It's dazzling!" "It's great!" "Come over here!"
"I'm happy!" "It's great!" "Come closer!"
Our hearts become one... and sparkle!!


Once again today, I am grateful for all the support
(With you) I want to talk with all of you, that's the peak of joy

It can't be expressed with words alone; What should we do?
(At times like these) Let's sing, we have to sing

One by one, we leap forward
To capture this moment that won't come twice
Do you still remember the wishes you once made?
Let's dance our Sensations within the light!

With you I've made it here, up to this point
Everyone's feelings reached us, thank you
Finally we made it here together, so let's enjoy ourselves
The story that we will bring to life together, our earnest Story
"It's dazzling!" "It's great!" "Over here!"
"I'm happy!" "It's great!" "Come closer!"
Our unending dream is
Sparkling... Sparkling!!!

Hi! Hi! Our dream is never ending!


One by one, we leap forward
To capture this moment that won't come twice
Do you still remember the wishes you once made?
Let's dance our Sensations within the light!

With you I've made it here, up to this point
Everyone's feelings reached us, thank you
Finally we made it here together, so let's enjoy ourselves
The story that we will bring to life together, our earnest Story

The miracle is right here and now
Everyone's feelings led them to this place
That's why, we'll enjoy this moment
The story that we will bring to life together, the Story of our dreams
"It's dazzling!" "It's great!" "Come over here!"
"I'm happy!" "It's great!" "Come closer!"
Our hearts become one... and sparkle!!
