"Sweet words are unnecessary"
That's a lie... The truth is I've been waiting forever
It's a fleeting silhouette of hope
While suffering the pain, I withdraw into myself

I already wanted to give up, and just simply be friends
And even though no one asked
My loneliness broke off all conversation

That's just unkind. But to you,
who wanted to appear kind
You helped me with my hopeless wish
But you know, there's a danger that someday all this could fall apart
And to continue on pretending not to see that, I'm starting to become afraid

Strong emotions are more powerful than happiness
Why is it... like a poison, it can't be stopped
Just like the taboo of a forbidden game
Maybe it's simply something like a bad dream

And without reward, I keep on repeating it
It's just as you told me, isn't it
The loneliness keeps piercing through me

I want to be loved by you, but you
are in love with someone else
My steady pure heart won't change
That's why that "someday" won't come
Because we aren't tied together
Let's continue pretending not to see it, just like now...

And without reward, I keep on repeating it
It's just as you told me, isn't it
The loneliness keeps piercing through me

I want to be loved by you, but you
are in love with someone else
My steady pure heart won't change
That's why I turned my back
I can't say it, I can't think it
Anyway, time is what I want, to be right here
