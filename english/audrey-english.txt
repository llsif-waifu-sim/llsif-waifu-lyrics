Even the Audrey I adore
Had to have felt so lonely
But with how radiant her gaze is, I can't begin to imagine it

Sometimes I can't understand my real feelings
Who's perspective am I thinking from now?

What does it mean to act naturally?
Is it different than playing as myself?

Every time I start asking these questions again
A new me will surely be born

Even the Audrey I adore
Had to have felt so lonely
But with how radiant her gaze is, I can't begin to imagine it
If it's for my beloved Audrey I'd act without hesitation
I shouldn't show you any of my sufferings
That's right, because I have to be a great actress

I know in my head what I have to do
But my heart just can't keep up

I think and think, but I reach no answer
I just have to go blind, and feel my way

One day I'll reach my Audrey
I'm alright, don't worry
I might trip, or get lost, but my progress won't stop
One day I will reach her
She urges me to follow
And once there I'll have my answer
Step by step, I'm closer to being a great actress

People really aren't that strong
Everyone one has their own fears
But once you overcome your weaknesses, oh how you'll shine

Even the Audrey I adore
Had to have felt so lonely
But with how radiant her gaze is, I can't begin to imagine it
If it's for my beloved Audrey I'd act without hesitation
I shouldn't show you any of my sufferings
That's right, because I have to be a great actress
