Summer wing
Fly high, Summer wing

Why did tomorrow's heart-pounding excitement appear to me… What should I do?
Catch it, Shinin' more, Dreamin' more
We'll have so much fun!

Wings sprout out, taking my heart above the clouds
Lured to a distant sky, a distant beach
Speed up and F.L.Y!!

While basking tons and tons in the sunlight
(Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, a dazzling feeling)
(Sparkle, sparkle, shimmering, sweat drips)
Let's pile up the shining memories (Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, shining dreams)
I had searched for this one-time season

It's midsummer's fault, 1,2,Jump!
A shower of light bursts out
This feeling is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement, it’s Vacation (Summer wing)
With a summer-colored smile, 1,2,Jump!
I want to show you a twinkling face
Being together is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement! (Summer wing)

The weather's hot but (Because things are hot) Because things are hot (It's nice)
It's nice (And fun) And fun
Summer day

Our hearts pound as we pass by each other… What could be the matter?
I'll chase it, that's right, Shinin', that's right, Dreamin'
What a mysterious premonition

I feel nostalgia from the passing breeze
If I look up, I'll see a distant sky, a distant beach
Enthusiastically T.R.Y!!

Because we were able to meet here at long, long last
(Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, a happy feeling)
(Sparkle, sparkle, shimmering, we were able to meet here)
Create fantastic memories with me! (Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, my dreams)
I had searched for a miracle within your warm heart

A light more definite than the stars, 1,2,Love!
If such a light illuminates the night
The future will exist, it exists, right?
This is the best Location (Summer time)
Launching someone's throbbing heart, 1,2,Love!
All the way to the stars
Hope exists, it exists, right?
State your desires

A light more definite than the stars, 1,2,Love!
If such a light illuminates the night
The future will exist, it exists, right?
Nod in agreement, it's Vacation

It’s midsummer's fault, 1,2,Jump!
A shower of light bursts out
This feeling is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement, it's Vacation (Summer wing)
With a summer-colored smile, 1,2,Jump!
I want to show you a twinkling face
Being together is great, isn't it great?
Nod in agreement! (Summer wing)
The weather's hot but (Because things are hot) Because things are hot (It's nice)

It's nice (And fun) And fun
Summer day
