This dream is fun, isn’t it?
Let’s sing our happiness with a smile!
That signals the beginning!
One step at a time, from you One step at a time, from me 
We want to go somewhere… to the stage in our heart!

Trying to accept each other
we will hesitate a bit at first,
but there is a place which will accept us.
I keep on wanting to know more and more. 
(More!)

SUNNY DAY SONG
SUNNY DAY SONG fly higher and higher!
I feel we can overcome anything coming our way!
SUNNY DAY SONG
SUNNY DAY SONG whenever we hum it
our hopes for tomorrow grow and grow, it’s a great feeling!

SUNNY DAY Wow! Sun power!
SUNNY DAY Wow! Song power!

This dream makes me happy,
so let’s all talk about everything.
That signals our bond!
The second step is taken firmly The third step, confidently.
We dance feeling like we can go forwards without fear!

If you try reaching out
thing will become more and more enjoyable! (More fun!)

SUNNY DAY LIFE let’s shine!
What should I say to be able to share how I’m feeling right now?
SUNNY DAY LIFE
SUNNY DAY LIFE you too dance!
Embraced by the thought of happiness I feel we can do anything!
