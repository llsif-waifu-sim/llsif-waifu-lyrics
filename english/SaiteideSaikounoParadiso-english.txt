Because it's a dream that's not like a dream
Shut your eyes and stay forever in the land of dreams
Oh! Baby I want to trap your pure eyes
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, Falling love!!

Stop playing games, come here seriously
Princess this and princess that, I'm tired of hearing that
Oh! Baby I want to be kidnapped violently with passion
Don't get lost, don't get lost, Falling love!!

It's amazing, how our hearts are attracted beyond anything
Show me the flame of love, let it illuminate me

Paradiso!!
I want to try winning tonight's adventure with its dangerous rules
It's a premonition we'll find the best of us through the worst
Paradiso!!
Tonight's adventure is an unexpected Fantasy with dangerous rules
Maybe I'm falling in love, falling in love
"Falling in love is fine too"... I won't let you say that

(Oh! Baby Paradiso yeah!! Oh! Baby Paradiso yeah!!)

Because it's a dream that's not like a dream
I'm a seductress leading you on
Shut your eyes and stay forever in the land of dreams
A Dream that will never reach anyone's eyes

Always seeking each other, wanting our hearts to become one
Show me the flame of love, let it illuminate me

Mio amore!!
I want to harshly steal it all with the smile of a goddess
I want to give you the best memories through the worst
Mio amore!!
I want to harshly hug it all with the smile of a goddess
Maybe I'm becoming strange, becoming strange
"Becoming strange is fine too"... Maybe I want to let you say that


Paradiso!!
I want to try winning tonight's adventure with its dangerous rules
It's a premonition we'll find the best of us through the worst
Mio amore!!
I want to harshly steal it all with the smile of a goddess
I want to give you the best memories through the worst
Mio amore!!
I want to harshly hug it all with the smile of a goddess
Maybe I'm becoming strange, becoming strange
