Hey... Now listen

You're my first and most precious;
You're my dearest treasure
My memories are overflowing with love for you
I'm always running around day by day
We hold hands as time goes by
I've become stronger because of your warmth

I may be alone but,
I've already outstretched my arms as far as they'll go
Our dreams are so big that they can't be contained, so now
Let's embrace them together

Butterfly, if you spread your wings
You can fly high into the distance
Beyond our courage
Lies a beautiful sky
Butterfly
Just fly toward your dreams
And let's welcome the season of flowers
I'm sure we'll be able to make it happen
Believe that we can fly!

There's more than I can count,
Precious days we spend together
All those smiles and tears that I share with you
That sudden rainy day
Even with the headwind, we came through
We'll be able to go through all that lies ahead, too

Already before you knew it
If you reach out your hand, you'll see
A dream so close that we can almost reach it
I'll hold you tight, so please grab onto me

Touch the sky if you're lost
Let's draw our dreams freely
Beyond your smile
Waits the future we've always wanted
Brighter sky
Even if some tears spill
Don't worry, you're not alone
Let's go further and make it happen
I can tell you "We can Fly!"

With each of our dreams
With our own color
Let's move forward
Being ourselves

Let's spread our wings

Butterfly, if you spread your wings
You can fly high into the distance
Beyond our courage
Lies a beautiful sky
Butterfly, just fly toward your dreams
And let's welcome the season of flowers
I'm sure we'll be able to make it happen
Believe that we can fly!
