Cheers for the love!

I'm glad to be here, our present exists right here
Cheers for the love!
Itâ€™s only just begun, I'm counting on you again tomorrow, we've yet to reach our goal


Smile when you're sad, let's blow it all away
If you can laugh, the scenery will change, peeking through the clearing weather
Even when you're unsure, the road leading to happiness
Comes into view under the blue sky

Rain falls from time to time but it's harsh without water
Don't wither, nurture everyone's tree of dreams

Now!
Cheers for loving you!
With the courage to never give up, let's enjoy the present
Cheers for loving you!
We can do our best so wave goodbye to yesterday and look forward


Push forward even if it's difficult, I'm by your side
When we push forward, the burning sun will illuminate the east
The confusing, answer-less road to the future
Is something we can't say no one knows

The silver light falls into the sudden storm
Don't panic, everyone's tree of dreams are strong

Now!
Cheers for the love!
I'm glad to be here, our present exists right here
Cheers for the love!
It's only just begun, I'm counting on you again tomorrow, we've yet to reached our goal


Rain falls from time to time, the trunks sway in the wind
We'll go together, nurture everyone's tree of dreams

Now!
Cheers for loving you!
With the courage to never give up, let's enjoy the present
Cheers for loving you!
We can do our best so wave goodbye to yesterday and look forward
