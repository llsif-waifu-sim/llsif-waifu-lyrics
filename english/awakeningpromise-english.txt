Warming these small seeds
That were sowed into my heart
Before I knew it, that warmth
I was frantically pursuing was what I was feeling
We looked up at the same sky
And dreamed distant dreams
The seasons that passed by 
Finally brought us both here

A wind different from yesterday
Grabs hold of my heart, but (forever)
Our feelings are connected

This boulevard that leads to tomorrow
Has flowers of hope that bloom along it
I'll take the courage
That you gave me and hold it close...
We make this promise with smiles
And I'll make it bloom so vividly
I'm going to become stronger
(I Promise to you)
I want to tell you so many thank yous

I'm moving forward my own way
This future that we envisioned
Let's make it a reality someday...!!

The sceneries we see are different
And the time we spend together is different too
But the feelings I want to send go beyond the sky
Our hearts are connected

I've decided that
I want to walk down this path more (because)
I want to cherish this excitement

Even on the days I wanted to cry and give up
Something always bloomed inside of me
Because everyone has taught me
About the power of courage
No matter what, I'll keep walking
Let's walk with love in our hearts
It may be small
But I'll keep taking baby steps today
(I Promise to you)
I want so see so many smiles

When I love back in the middle of the road
I see the dream I thought about
I want to give you my heart
And not stop walking...!!

This boulevard that leads to tomorrow
Has flowers of hope that bloom along it
I'll take the courage
That you gave me and hold it close...
We make this promise with smiles
And I'll make it bloom so vividly
I'm going to become stronger
(I Promise to you)
I want to tell you so many thank yous

I'm moving forward my own way
This future that we envisioned
Let's make it a reality someday...!!
