Right now...
We want, to try changing the future!
After all, we've only just started to notice our dreams

For a trigger, anything will do, so
Let's search for excitement together (Heave-ho! Excitement alright)
If it's something you truly wish for
Try proving that you can make it come true

Where can someone as small and insignificant as myself end up flying to?
And I keep telling myself, "I don't know, I just don't know!"
(We'll make it somehow) Ah! Let's start

Is your heart shining?
If you can hear your heart, then answer "Yes!!"
I wonder if this encounter will be able to change everyone?
The sun is shining on our dreams today as well

(Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)

I'm really bad with dealing with boredom
Let's go all out when playing, ok? (Got it! Going all out, alright)
Even during the times when we're lost
Take firm steps and dash towards our goal with all we've got

If you give up just because it didn't go well
You'll definitely regret it later (...that's right)
That's why, even if it's unreasonable, I want to try even if I don't know what will come afterwards
I just don't know, but it seems interesting
(We might be able to make it somehow) Come on, over here!

Just how many times are you able to get back on your feet?
Put your hand on your heart: it'll laugh out "Yes!!"
I still don't know the meaning behind this encounter, but
Even though we don't know, our dreams we has awakened are still bright

(Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)

Is your heart shining?
If you can hear your heart, then answer "Yes!!"
I wonder if this encounter will be able to change everyone?
The sun is shining on our dreams today as well
Just how many times are you able to get back on your feet?
Put your hand on your heart: it'll laugh out "Yes!!"
I still don't know the meaning behind this encounter, but
Even though we don't know
Our dreams are still bright (Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)
We've awakened now (Oh yes, Doki-Doki Sunshine)

Right now...
We might, have started to change our future!
That's right, we've only just started to notice our dreams
