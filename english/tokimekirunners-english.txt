Being born is exciting, to be charmed is radiant
The world began changing on that day
Looking isn't enough, move your body
Is there anything we can do? Let's find it!

Is this a dream? Dream is a lovely word
Just saying it raises your mood
We decided it was a dream
Ah, courage welled up within!

An exciting story we fulfill
What happens is up to us
A meeting, we can call that a miracle
An exciting story we can fulfill
Let's have fun together
“Live!” Our hearts shouted
We want that feeling
(We want to be excited with you, telling an exciting story)
Let's begin! (Let's get excited together!)

The inspiration came suddenly, a murmur that maybe we could do it
From now we'll travel the world
There's lots we don't know, our emotions swell
There's something we can do, though we don't know what it is

Do you want to dream? You can dream anytime
You might realize you're already dreaming!
So let's forge onward
Wah, called forth by hope

Shine, searching for tomorrow
We decide what we want to do
Wishes are such beautiful things
Shine, searching for tomorrow
Let's smile together
“We'll do our best!” Our hearts shout
And we run off

Where should we go? (Anywhere!)
Ask excitedly
What we love is a key
Place your hand on your chest and try to hear the love!

Shine, searching for tomorrow
We decide what we want to do
Wishes are such beautiful things
Shine, searching for tomorrow
Let's smile together
“We'll do our best!” Our hearts shout, everyone together!

An exciting story we fulfill
What happens is up to us
A meeting, we can call that a miracle
An exciting story we can fulfill
Let's have fun together
“Live!” Our hearts shouted
We want that feeling
(We want to be excited with you, telling an exciting story)
Let's begin! (Let's get excited together!)
(We want to be excited with you, telling an exciting story)
Let's begin! (Let's get excited together!)
