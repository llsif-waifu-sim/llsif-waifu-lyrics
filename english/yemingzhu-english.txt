Hey you what's going on?
You keep glancing at me; are you really that 
(Interested in me? I know right?)
(I understand it clearly)

All day and night day and night and, all day all night
Love me love me do?

Sweetness? Only being sweet is pure nonsense
I'll be bitter to the point of sweetness, that sounds good
(Are you curious? I know right?)
(I understand it clearly)

All day and night day and night and, all day all night
Love me love me do?

I want to get fired up endlessly in my world
I like you too
But I won't look back at ya

Do you want me?
Hey! make me excited!! I'll bring you deeper and deeper into this obsession
Hey! make me excited!! I'm the pearl that everyone covets

Na na naâ€¦
My heart's pounding

Hey! make me excited!! Tell me now, tell me now
Do you still want me?
