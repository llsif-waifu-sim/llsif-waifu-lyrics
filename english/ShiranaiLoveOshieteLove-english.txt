A wind blew, I want to be swept away by an intense gale

You suddenly noticed…Noticed that I want to see you
Waiting to go home after school’s unbearable

Leaning within the shadows of the trees along the road alone
Even if I look down and count just the footsteps it’s no good…No, no good!

Feel the fate (Is what I wish for)
This is the first time the uneasiness in my chest has made me want to cry

Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m inexperienced, I dizzily Cry
Looking at someone this way
Have I changed so much?
Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m a coward yet I can’t stop
When I attempted to go a little beyond my limits
A wind blew, I want to be swept away by your gale

My heart throbbed…Throbbed from my hastening heartbeat
The curiosity’s hotter than the pain-inducing fever

Get closer to me, I want you to call out to me
Still not knowing even each other’s names, I hate it…Hate, hate it!

If I believe in fate (It’ll come true)
We shouldn’t need things like words, Let it start with our eyes

Childish Heart*Opening Heart
Am I purehearted? There’s still more to go mind
This feeling of love is a yet unknown adventure
How will I change?
Childish Heart*Opening Heart
Hold me and take me to the moon
Forgive me for all my wishes
My desire to see your dreams is greater than the number of stars

Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m inexperienced, I dizzily Cry
Looking at someone this way
Have I changed so much?
Unknown Love*Teach me Love
I’m a coward yet I can’t stop
When I attempted to go a little beyond my limits
A wind blew, I want to be swept away by your gale

Unknown Love*Teach me Love
