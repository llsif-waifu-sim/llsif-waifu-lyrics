One day... What would you do if the stairs of the sea
Appeared at the end of the waves? Would you like to go together?
Mermaids call you
Overlapping with a world of blue dreams

The scenery turned into a myth, and Neptune raises the heavens
If the fish with pearl-colored lace dance
Mermaids will call you
Let's dive into our memories and swim

What would happen? What would happen?

I'll close my eyes, and when I open them
The sky, the sea, and the sun shine like eternity
Oh, how beautiful

I want to savor every second of it
Because it's my favorite place
You and I are here, and we're living in the moment

One day...it'll feel like forever!
One day...it'll feel like forever!
