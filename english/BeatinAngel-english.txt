Break down!

Well? Signs of a slight fever
Come a little closer
I know!! Let me cure that for you

Even if you just sit there I still know
You're in pretty bad shape
Your chest feels hot, it feels painful
You've done it (at last), you've fallen in love

Soon...
"I want to be alone with you disease" has befallen you
Let me give you a sweet medicine

Beat in Angel
Have fun, temporary as it may be
Seriously?! Angel
My needle doesn't hurt at all
If you meet my gentle eyes you'll be numb from passion
Prepare yourself - you can't escape
Feather-covered Angel Beat!!

Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Wow...

Hey! You're not allowed to move
I'll hug you tightly
You know? The beat is growing more dangerous

We can't just stay simply friends
Your symptoms are awful
Sigh (turmoil) sigh (suspicious)
You've done it (come on), how's love feel?

Anyhow...
"I want to steal your lips disease" has befallen you
Let me give you a strong medicine

Love in Angel
I'll make you feel intense, captive to premonition
Seriously?! Angel
My hand softly, softly touches you
It makes me want to put you into a daze, earnest shy boy
I want you to tell me you won't run
Whimsical Angel Love!!

Beat in Angel
Have fun, temporary as it may be
Seriously?! Angel
My needle doesn't hurt at all
Beat in Angel
Have fun, temporary as it may be
Seriously?! Angel
You and me, that's bad, risky, dangerous
If you meet my gentle eyes you'll be numb from passion
Prepare yourself - you can't escape
Feather-covered Angel Beat!!

Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Oh,baby! Dance dance Angelic!!
Wow...
