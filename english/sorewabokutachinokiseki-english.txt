So... With courage, we will make our dreams come true
With an indomitable spirit, let's run toward the future

A strong, strong wish
Always guides us on our way
We're not going to compromise on things we love
We'll seize whatever time we have left

We won't settle for fond memories
Let's dash with all our might
(Chance for me! Chance for you!)

So... Once you've embraced your dreams, look up
You'll find big changes to your world
So... With courage, we will make our dreams come true
With an indomitable spirit, let's run toward the future

In the midst of our burning anticipation
Let's sing happily
Try to feel the same feelings
Enjoy our limited time

The passion that can no longer be stopped has won
Rather than regret, we'll try to keep running
The sky that we suddenly see, it is so blue
It's alright; we'll run without giving up
(Dance with me! Dance with you!)

Yes... That day I dreamed of seeing everyone's smiles
Because I saw your smile, I laughed
Yes... That day we painted the same dream
Our sparkling eyes believe in tomorrow

(Hi! Hi!ã€€Until the very end, we'll run through!)

So... Once you've embraced your dreams, look up
You'll find big changes to your world
So... With courage, we will make our dreams come true
With an indomitable spirit, let's run toward the future

Yes... That day I dreamed of seeing everyone's smiles
Because I saw your smile, I laughed
Yes... That day we painted the same dream
Our sparkling eyes believe in tomorrow
With an indomitable spirit, we'll believe in tomorrow

This encounter is a miracle
Never forget, this moment is ours
