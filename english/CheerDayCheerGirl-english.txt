Hey hey hey, look at me, hey hey hey, over here
Hey hey hey, share your vigor and come here Yay! 

Let’s fight, I say “chance!”
Let’s fight, You know “chance!”
Let’s fight, You gotta chance!!

Pointing at the sky, "Let's soar tomorrow, okay?"
Because it's you who's saying it, I start feeling uneasy (feeling uneasy!)
You're always overdoing it, getting angry for some reason
But I love it when you're laughing
(My chest will tighten… but it’s a secret)

Look over here for a bit (hey hey over here!)

CheerDay CheerGirl! In front of your eyes (Hey hey!)
CheerDay CheerGirl! I want to say it (Hey hey!!)
People who do their best are wonderful, everyone is thinking that!
CheerDay CheerGirl! In front of your eyes (Hey hey!)
CheerDay CheerGirl! I want to say it (Hey hey!!)
In order for our dreams to definitely come true, we will be cheering
Wave your arms and wave your pompons, Yay! Let’s fight!

Let’s fight, I say “chance!”
Let’s fight, You know “chance!”
Let’s fight, You gotta chance!!

If you fall down, you’ll pretend to be asleep 
It seems like you will do that, but won't you feel sad? (pat pat)
Your zealous face is great, I’m secretly looking at you 
Since I want to try taking photos of you
(This firm patience… it’s kind of cute)

Share my vigor (fill it up!)

CheerDay CheerBoy! Keep your spirits up (Hey hey!)
CheerDay CheerBoy! Let’s move forward (Hey hey!!)
Times when you try your best are lovely, wasn't that a wise saying?
CheerDay CheerBoy! Keep your spirits up (Hey hey!)
CheerDay CheerBoy! Let’s move forward (Hey hey!!)
New dreams are continuously being born, we will be cheering
Wave your pompons until it hurts, Yay! Let’s fight!

Therefore, look over here (hey hey over here)

CheerDay CheerGirl! In front of your eyes (Hey hey!)
CheerDay CheerGirl! I want to say it (Hey hey!!)
People who do their best are wonderful, everyone is thinking that!
CheerDay CheerGirl! In front of your eyes (Hey hey!)
CheerDay CheerGirl! I want to say it (Hey hey!!)
In order for our dreams to definitely come true, we will be cheering
Wave your arms and wave your pompons, Yay! Let’s fight!
Wave your pompons until it hurts, Yay! Let’s fight!
