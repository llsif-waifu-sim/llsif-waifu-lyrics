I say hello to the sun peeking through the curtains
What a nice warm feeling, time to curl up and take a nap
Hey! Your foot is in my way
This is my soft place
Hmph. Play with me, just for a little while more
It's another lively day of housesitting

I’m not waiting for the sound of the door opening
or maybe I am waiting
Master, I was here first!
No, it was me! No, me! Meow meow

Happy meow meow meow days
Will forever be like this friendly time, meow
I love these meow meow meow days
We've been waiting for you to hold us tightly
"Welcome home" and "thank you"
Even if we can’t say them in words, we’ll exclaim 
Ready, set...
Meow!!!

Slipping out the window to go on a great adventure
On the roof I go! Hello to the friends I run up to
Something smells really nice
Is it time for dinner yet?
Nope, I'm still playing with everyone
A care-free kitty paradise

I'm covered in mud
I wonder if my muddy pawprints will anger my master
Master, please forgive me!
I won't do it again... You liar!!! Meow meow!

Lucky meow meow meow days
Surely, as long as my master is beside me, meow
Everyday is a meow meow meow day
It passes in a flash, I’m so happy I’m embarrassed
I'm lonely...I miss you...
When we want you to spend time with us, we'll exclaim
Ready, set...
Meow!!!

We want you to pat us, meow meow
Can you hear us purring, meow?
We want to be pampered more
Everyone together! Meow meow meow

Happy meow meow meow days
Will forever be like this friendly time, meow
I love these meow meow meow days
Everyone is being affectionate, we want you to hold us tightly

Lucky meow meow meow days
Surely, as long as my master is beside me, meow
Everyday is a meow meow meow day
It passes in a flash, I’m so happy I’m embarrassed
I'm lonely...I miss you...
When we want you to spend time with us, we'll exclaim
Ready, set...
Meow!!!
