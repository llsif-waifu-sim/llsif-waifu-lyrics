Hello, called by the music
the brightly lit town seems like a carnival!
Hello, if we try answering it
I’m sure our world will expand bit by bit.
Hello.

Shall we join in the dancing at the intersection?
Everything feels so free here!
It feels like we’ll be swallowed
by the oncoming wave of people!
We don’t know the words to this melody
but strangely it fills up with strength!

Hello, if we count the stars
and start to divine what we will come across in the future,
Hello, it will be impossible to foretell.
But I’m sure if we’re together we can enjoy anything!
Hello, what will happen when we wake up tomorrow?
What should we do?

Filled with excitement, I feel something is about to start!
Everything feels so radiant, we stretch out our hands high.

I wonder what this excitement is…
Our own lively rhythm,
our tempo is set, feels like we can fly into the night sky!
A brand new melody,
we don’t know the words to this melody
but strangely it fills up with strength!

Hello, it’s a message from the stars
so let’s touch upon our dreams while we’re full of energy!
Hello, this warmth is eternal.
I’m sure if we’re together we can enjoy anything!
Hello

I love new world!
Ah, this is a new world!
This feeling of always wanting to try new things
will never disappear, will it?
It will always bring us happiness, won’t it? (That’s right!)
The stars (shine) the stars (glitter) are so pretty!
See, they fill us up with strength!
(Everyone, everyone!)

Hello, it’s a message from the stars
so let’s touch upon our dream as we’re full of energy!
Hello, this warmth is eternal.
I’m sure everything will be fun if we’re together!
Hello

Hello, if we count the stars
and start to divine what we will come across in the future,
Hello, it will be impossible to foretell.
But I’m sure if we’re together we can enjoy anything!

Hello, what will happen when we wake up tomorrow?
What should we do?
