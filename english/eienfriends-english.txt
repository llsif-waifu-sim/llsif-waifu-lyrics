The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing,
But I’ll cherish it more.
Let’s dream and laugh – I don’t want to lose that.

We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!


As we share the same experiences,
We take the same steps toward adulthood.
Things will keep going that way forever, I expect…
I want to find out for sure, but I don’t really know how.

Even if I have faith that things won’t change,
Just a little bit of loneliness crept in
When I was watching the profile of your face.

The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (La la la la)
But tomorrow just might hold one step down a different road.
The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (Always…)
But I’ll cherish it more.
I don’t want to lose you – don’t let go of my hand.

We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!


I tried to pretend I was strong,
So I actually became strong – we’ve tried so hard together.
Not being alone is a happy feeling.
You’ve listened to me in times of worry – you’ve saved me.

Inside, I wish that things won’t change.
Is that just me being selfish?
But it would really be great if we could stay together, on and on…

Dreaming, laughing, crying – let those days we spent together shine bright. (La la la la)
They’re a treasure more radiant than any precious stones.
Dreaming, laughing, crying – those days we spent together are so dear to me. (Dreaming…)
I’d like to add on even more,
Though we haven’t decided what we should aim for next.

We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!
Don’t say that it’s just for now – this is eternal.
Don’t say that it’s just for now – wow, wow…

I want to see the dream, together with you.
I want to see the dream, to laugh and cry… Ah!

The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (La la la la)
But tomorrow just might hold one step down a different road.
The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve thought of as a regular thing, (Always…)

I don’t want to lose you – don’t let go of my hand.

Don’t say that it’s just for now – wow, wow…
We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!
