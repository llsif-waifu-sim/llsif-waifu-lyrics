Simply kind words aren’t enough anymore
Trembling I sigh, You’re so close I want to to try touching you

Getting this close was not by chance and yet
Feigning ignorance and showing off a smile is a crime

As we walk side by side, pausing our conversation
I want a button for love (Clicking and ordering) Let’s start

At the beginning we got a little closer
I reflect on the happiness that came from meeting
Forever (baby) Forever (maybe)
I won’t forget how my heart pounded
It’s always okay
Our meeting invites tomorrow
It would be great if I could tell you (Because I want to tell you)
We stopped suddenly and gazed at one another...

If these feelings catch a ride on the wind and tickle your ears
You should be able to hear my warm and sweet thoughts

I tried imagining it but I don’t understand at all
I planned to know but I don’t understand the real you

This secret is a frustration, expanding selfishly on its own
There’s a single button for love (As soon as it was clicked) Things started

Suddenly handling it with a joke
Your evasive eyes are lost
But (sorry) But (worry)
I don’t want it to be painful
It’s okay in front of your eyes
Because I’ll promise, Because I love you
Feeling this strongly (I want to say it right now)
Still unable to say it we gazed at one another...

At the beginning we got a little closer
I reflect on the happiness that came from meeting
Forever (baby) Forever (maybe)
I won’t forget how my heart pounded
It’s always okay
Our meeting invites tomorrow
It would be great if I could tell you (Because I want to tell you)
We stopped suddenly and gazed at one another... Did I click the button?
