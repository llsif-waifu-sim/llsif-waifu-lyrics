I'm okay, everything's fine!
Though you may be sad, you have to answer
Everyone, please realize
That's not the real me, I'm just putting up a strong front

Why not try crying? Just a little
If I presented myself as someone different, could I change?

Ebbing and rising,
The waves of my heart wash me away
The strength to desire something this much
Is the passionate Reason in my chest

That's strange; I'm feeling fervent!
Once you've taken the first step, you've gotta run
Has everyone gone through this?
Everything starts to pick up; Ah, I can't stop

I think I want to give those things a try;
I'll walk forwards while counting them

Breaking and then retreating,
The shining waves filled my gaze
The spirit to dive into an unknown world
was the Reason born within me, why now?

Crying is a thing of yesterday
I feel like I can grow stronger now

Ebbing and rising,
The waves of my heart wash me away
The strength to desire something this much
It is the passionate Reason in my chest
