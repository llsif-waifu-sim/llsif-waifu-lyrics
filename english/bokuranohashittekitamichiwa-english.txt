That's right!
I always wanted to shine I wanted to make it all start
While meeting friends along the way we've come to run down a path
Starting from scratch towards a one how difficult could that really be?
But what happened then (But what happened then) that became a connection

That's right!
I didn't understand it and went through tears and sweat
My friends encouraged me and we've come to this path
Look up the grand and blue sky in a day to day I want to tell
That's why we all (That's why we all) Got ourselves giving our all!

Always my dreams are inside my heart
Even if I start to loose their sight
And that's why we are never giving up!
Because we finally saw that light
Even if I became a bit obsessed I believed It'd change, I believed it 
With all of you 

That's right!
One after another, all my wishes came true
It was nice to have met all my friends and going down this path
But you see there's an end to everything we have started
So where should we go? (Where should we go?) Obviously to our goal!

So all, let's run even further than now
Despite all my care I'm still worried
And that's why we are never going to stop!
Because I want to feel that warmth
And in a very different form 
A new dream I want to see

Aah, what should we do? (Thinking ahead)
Aah, what should we do? (Where should we head?)
Can you see? Can you tell? Our future selves do...?

That's right
As expected from myself I tried to cast a spell
Accepting that I should see them all off, my dear friends, with sorrow
It's not the end, it's all right, let's cheer up, let's laugh it off!
I want to see if (I want to see if) We can still give it some more!

So all, let's run even further than now
Despite all my care I'm still worried
And that's why we are never going to stop!
Because I want to feel that warmth
And in a very different form 
A new dream I want to see

So when the curtain rises up we are going to sing forever
And an endless dream we will see!
