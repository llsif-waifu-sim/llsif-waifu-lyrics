Fly to you! Love you love you puwa puwa
(Love you love you, puwa puwa! Let's go love you love you, puwa puwa!)

I want to see you see you, BABY (Love you love you, puwa puwa!)
I want to see you, my wings are beating, beating faster, quickly.
(Let's go love you love you, puwa puwa, love you love you, puwa puwa!)

When you find me, capture me (Puwa puwa, puwa puwa!)
Our love rushes about the vast sky (Puwa puwa, puwa puwa!)
Throughout the world, there's no love like ours (OH! YES!!)

So then, wa-oh wa-oh! If this is a dream
Hey hey hey? Wa-oh wa-oh! Don't wake up
I've always, always liked you
It's strange, since when?
Wa-oh wa-oh! If this is a dream
Hey hey hey? Wa-oh wa-oh! Don't wake up
I've always, always liked you
It's strange, why do I?
(Love you love you, puwa puwa! Let's go love you love you, puwa puwa!)


Alone is no good, baby (Kiss kiss, puwa puwa)
When I'm alone the tears fall in a line, down my cheek in a line
(Give me kiss kiss, puwa puwa, kiss kiss, puwa puwa!)

I'm swimming around inside our love (Puwa puwa, puwa puwa)
Don't break my heart (Puwa puwa, puwa puwa!)
Throughout the world, there's no-one like you (OH! YES!!)

Then, wa-oh wa-oh! If this isn't a dream
Tightly, wa-oh wa-oh! Hold me close
I've always, always liked you
I'll show you, so believe me?
Wa-oh wa-oh! If this isn't a dream
Tightly, wa-oh wa-oh! Hold me close
I've always, always liked you
I'll show you right now!

I miss you, I miss you, I'm going to see you
I miss you, I miss you, BE MY BABY
I miss you, I miss you, I'm going to see you
I miss you, I miss you, wait for me

Fly to you! Love you love you, puwa puwa!


Then wa-oh wa-oh! If this isn't a dream
Tightly, wa-oh wa-oh! Hold me close
I've always, always liked you
I'll show you, so believe me?
Wa-oh wa-oh! If this isn't a dream
Tightly, wa-oh wa-oh! Hold me close
I've always, always liked you 
I'll show you, so believe me PLEASE!

It's strange!
Love you love you, puwa puwa, love you love you, puwa puwa!
Give me kiss kiss, puwa puwa, kiss kiss, puwa puwa!
