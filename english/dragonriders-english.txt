I was wondering which way to go when I jumped on board
This dragon's back feels really nice
Go forth! Go forth into the clear blue sky
Let's fly to the ends of the world

There's so much I want to see. I want to see it with my own eyes.
I want to hear what everyone's wishes are
I want to cuddle you and be there for you too
I'm always thinking about you

Neither here nor there, neither here nor there, neither here nor there, neither here nor there
OK, I'll wait. OK, I'm sure it'll work out.
What can we do? What can we do?
We're friends, afterall

Let's play over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
It's all right, I'll wait for you. It's all right, I'm sure it'll work out.
What can we do? What can we do?
C'mon, I'm coming to meet you all
