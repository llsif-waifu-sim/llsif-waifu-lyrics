I can take off into the Dreaming Sky
Because I'm not alone
Wherever it is, I feel like I can go
Across the distant sky

As I wish hard now
To soar higher and higher, look!

I've been hiding it for some time now, deep within my heart
Pretending that I hadn't noticed these budding emotions
Lacking in self-confidence, I was hanging my head
At that time, you pushed me on

The warmth of our connected hands
Filled my chest with courage

Let's start our journey out on the Dreaming Way
And continue into the future
A beam of light is shining from the dream that has just begun
It's thrilling, this Dreaming Light
It's not enough to put it into words
So I am putting it into a song
and I wish for it to reach you
Beating my heart

The same old roads and the shimmering rays of sunshine
Somehow, they look a bit different today

I won't hesitate to run forward
Because this path is illuminated by courage

I want to make it come true, my Dream with you
It's steeped in brilliance
A brand new dream, filled with hope
Let's chase the Dreaming Light
and I'll truly be myself
There's a scene I want to show you
You'll have to wait for it,
Make a promise

There's a gentle wind wrapping around me
Ah, isn't it warm?
They're overflowing, these endless thoughts
Please carry them to tomorrow

I can take off into the Dreaming Sky
Because I'm not alone
Wherever it is, I feel like I can go
Across the distant sky

Let's start our journey out on the Dreaming Way
And continue into the future
A beam of light is shining from the dream that has just begun
It's thrilling, this Dreaming Light
It's not enough to put it into words
So I am putting it into a song
and I wish for it to reach you
Beating my heart
