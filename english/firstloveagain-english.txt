The sky is dyed in shades of red
As today is coming to an end
Even if I wanted to leave something behind
There's nothing I can do

"It's okay, I don't really mind," you said
Your gentle smile never wavered
But on my way home, the familiar path felt a bit different

I'll forget about all the sadness and the pain
Leave everything as it is in today
As long as you're with me, I'll be okay
Everyday will be reborn anew

Tomorrow, I want to see you again, tomorrow's you
And the thrill of meeting you will happen, just like the first time
Tomorrow and the day after, two of us will fall in love 
A first love that happens again and again
