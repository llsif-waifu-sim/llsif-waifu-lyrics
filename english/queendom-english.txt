Welcome to the Queendom

I heard the rumors, that's right
Everyone longs for it
(Yes I'm so special)
But I still don't have enough ambition
Yes, I am the best

Everything is yours
I'll take control of everything
Come on, take a look at my burning heart
Aah, we're starting a revolution

The golden time
It's starting, come, to an unknown world
(Hurry up, hurry up)
Common sense, bye bye
I may give you a chance to open up
(Hurry up, hurry up)
These orders I will not allow

You can't take your eyes off, right?
Come on! The golden time
It's starting, come, to an unknown world
(Hurry up, hurry up)
No problem, welcome to the queendom
Ooh yeah to the queendom
