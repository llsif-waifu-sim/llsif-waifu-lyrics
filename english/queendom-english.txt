I heard the rumors, that's right!
Everyone longs for it
(Yes, I'm so special)

But I still don't have enough ambition
Yes, I am the best!!

Everything is yours
I'll take control of everything
Come on, take a look at my burning heart
We're starting a revolution

The golden time!
It's starting, come, to an unknown world
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
Common sense, bye bye

I may give you a chance to open up
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
These orders I will not allow

You can't take your eyes off, right?
Come on! Come on!

The golden time!
It's starting, come, to an unknown world
(Hurry up! Hurry up!)
No problem!
Welcome to the Queendom
