Hide→ Open→ Hide, This isn’t love yet
Open→ Hide→ Open, Prepare yourself and chase after it
I want to start…WILD STARS

With a whimsical light I’ll find you
Let yourself be swept away by the stimulation on a night like this

Suffering from boredom, It sways my chest
The sudden storm was a passionate, wild wind

I searched forever and ever for a place to meet you
You and I came here
From now on the two of us, From now on we’ll shine

Hide→ Open→ Hide, This isn’t love yet
Open→ Hide→ Open, Prepare yourself and chase after it
I want to start…WILD STARS

Break free of the constellations, I want to dance with you
Show that gentle face only to me

Fire grows in my eyes, I can’t yield to anyone
The shock I sensed made me feel quite reckless

I want to see you I wish, surely, surely it’ll get through
And then you and I came
Right now the two of us, Right now we shine

Move→ Open→ Move, Come, this is turning into love
Open→ Move→ Open, We stand before the gates of love
If I whispered that…WILD LOVE

I want to distance myself from the lonely skies
I know I can do it if I’m with you
The darkness will vanish, Beyond the darkness
There’s a dazzling place, it’s there, it’s there, I can see it

Move→ Open→ Move, Come, this is turning into love
Open→ Move→ Open, We stand before the gates of love
If I whispered that what would you do? WILD STARS
