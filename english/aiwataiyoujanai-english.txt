Let's deliver happiness and smiles to everyone...

I think I'm starting to understand the sound that flows through my body
Our meeting wasn't unexpected
It's a miracle that we're so attracted to each other

It's important to have a dazzling smile that believes in the future

Love is like a sun, a big sun
The sunflowers lift their heads to follow it
Love is like a sun, illuminating the world
I want to bloom with the sunflowers
I want everyone to be full of joy!

Let's always be singing with a smile...

That's right, your eyes were so gentle as you frolicked
Before the tears began to spill
You nodded beautifully at me

Do your best, my heart; tomorrow we'll be going to a new world

The clouds of love bask in the light
And are softly enveloped in it
The clouds of love bring with them a warm breeze
Let's feel it together
And prepare to embrace everyone now!

Do your best, my heart; this is important
Now, a new future will be born for you and I

Love is like a sun, a big sun
The sunflowers lift their heads to follow it
Love is like a sun, illuminating the world
I want to bloom with the sunflowers
I want everyone to be full of joy!

Let's deliver happiness and smiles to everyone...
