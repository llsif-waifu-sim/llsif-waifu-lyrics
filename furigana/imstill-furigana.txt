Silhouettes of gray above the road I walk today
When was the last time I saw the reflection of my face?
It's easy just to say that everything will be okay
But is that the answer that's really deep inside my heart?

It's not always going to be a sunny day, I know
But if I try I might just get a glimpse

I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
雲  { くも }  を切り裂い  { きりさい }  て
空高く  { そらたかく }  へ fly free
心描  { こころびょう }  く景色  { けしき }  　私  { わたし }  だけの道  { みち }  
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming
