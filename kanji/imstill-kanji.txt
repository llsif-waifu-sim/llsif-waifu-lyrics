Silhouettes of gray above the road I walk today
When was the last time I saw the reflection of my face?
It's easy just to say that everything will be okay
But is that the answer that's really deep inside my heart?

It's not always going to be a sunny day, I know
But if I try I might just get a glimpse

I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
雲を切り裂いて
空高くへ fly free

心描く景色
私だけの道
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming...
I'm still dreaming...
