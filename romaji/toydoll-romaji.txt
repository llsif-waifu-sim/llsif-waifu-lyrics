Here we go, we go, we gotta go
'Cause I know, I know that miracles
Really do come true
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Three, two, one, let's go!

Come again? Tell me when you will understand
Don't pretend 'cause you're turning red again
Hey hey hey hey!

It's okay, I don't hate having company
We can call this a date now, don't you think?
Hey hey hey hey!

I know you like how I treat you like a toy doll
Play you around till you're begging that you want it all
Why don't we try going to a different level
Wanna play “house” with me?

Here we go, we go, we gotta go
'Cause I know, I know that miracles
Really do come true
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Let's go!
You and me, a team, how brilliant!
Now you'll see how sweet I really am
Don't you fall for me
Hey now baby! (Hey!) Baby! (Hey!)
Three, two, one, let's go!

Hey hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey!
